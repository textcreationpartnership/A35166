            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the great <hi>Voice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> taught by her Heavenly <hi>Eſpouſe,</hi> that according to the ordinary courſe ſet down by his <hi>Providence,</hi> none arrived to the knowledge of good and evil, can reach their <hi>Beatitude;</hi> but by the wings of <hi>Pennance.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Decree</hi> paſſed immediately after our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents tranſgreſsion, that <hi>he should not eat his Bread, but at the rate of ſweaty Browes:</hi> And though God ſeems to diſpenſe in this ſevere Sentence in the old Law, promiſing to the <hi>exact obſervers</hi> of it, <hi>long life, abundance of wealth,</hi> a <hi>plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful poſterity,</hi> and the like: Yet this was done (as he will leave no vertue unrewarded) in regard that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens Gates were then ſhut up: But when <hi>Chriſt</hi> had cleared their <hi>paſſage</hi> unto Eternal felicity, and clapt the <hi>Thorns</hi> (which were the fruit of our ſins) upon his <hi>own Head,</hi> then they recovered ſo high a Being, and grew to that value, as the <hi>heavier</hi> God layes his <hi>Hand</hi> upon us, the <hi>more</hi> his <hi>love</hi> appears: So that now the
<pb facs="tcp:54442:3"/> 
               <hi>mark</hi> of our happineſs is the <hi>Son of God</hi> not glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but <hi>ſcourged, ſpit upon, crowned with Thorns, torn with Whipps,</hi> and <hi>nailed to the Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it is we find our <hi>ſweet Redeemer</hi> born in <hi>Tears,</hi> bred up in <hi>obſcurity,</hi> and concluding the upſhot of his life with all the circumſtances of <hi>infamy</hi> and <hi>pain;</hi> at the opening of his grand commiſsion to preach unto the World, his firſt <hi>Exordium</hi> was an exhortation unto <hi>pennance,</hi> as if it were the ſole Loadſtone to draw Heaven towards us: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> his great Diſciple declares it; nay he makes no exception, that <hi>all thoſe who would be happy muſt crucify their flesh with their vices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee, <hi>Madam,</hi> that <hi>every Hand,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther innocent or guilty, whether noble or vulgar, ought to be ſtretched forth to ſow the bitter Seed of <hi>pennance:</hi> If we have ſucked in <hi>vertue</hi> even with our <hi>Milk,</hi> and thrived with a daily encreaſe in the ſequel of our life, yet we ought not (ſayes St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) deſcend into the <hi>Tomb</hi> but by the way of <hi>pennance:</hi> Again if we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with the <hi>Frailties</hi> of our corrupt nature, and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt the <hi>duty</hi> we owe to our good God, <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> likewiſe muſt be our <hi>Sanctuary:</hi> So that <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> is furniſhed with <hi>two Wings</hi> to bear us up to Heaven; the <hi>one</hi> is faſhioned out by <hi>love,</hi> which prompts us to become by a courſe of ſeverity, a true Copy of our ſuffering Original; the <hi>other</hi> is framed by ſtrokes of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and exacts worthy fruits; that is, ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:54442:3"/> may in ſome proportion be anſwerable to our failings; and though this <hi>other</hi> have not a motive altogether ſo Heroick, yet it ſpeaks a <hi>great vertue,</hi> becauſe it puts us upon a <hi>task</hi> the moſt knotty that can be imagined, as <hi>to appeaſe</hi> the face of an angry <hi>God.</hi> Beſides, it renders that Action <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>equitable,</hi> in that it aims <hi>to repair</hi> the injury and contempt thrown by ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his greatneſs: Wherefore we ought not to bluſh upon either of theſe accounts to wear the <hi>Liveries</hi> of <hi>pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:</hi> If on the <hi>former</hi> we mortify our <hi>ſenſes</hi> upon Earth, and veſt our ſelves with the habit of Chriſt ſhaped out to the Image of his <hi>Death,</hi> it is a perfect <hi>Metamorphoſy</hi> wrought by the power of <hi>love,</hi> and for which Figure the very Angels (were they capable of ſenſible impreſsions) would be glad to exchange with us: If on the <hi>latter;</hi> that is, the ſcore of <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> it Cancels all our Bonds of guilt, it raiſes us from an Abyſs of <hi>miſery,</hi> to the high dignity of <hi>Grace,</hi> by which we are adopted Sons and Heirs to Heaven. So that a <hi>penitential life</hi> cannot but find <hi>veneration</hi> amongſt all wiſe Men, and be highly acceptable in the ſight of God; ſince by our <hi>humiliations</hi> we labour to contribute to his <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>greatneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Madam,</hi> you may perhaps upon this diſcourſe wonder to behold in the <hi>Courts</hi> of Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo much of <hi>glory, pomp,</hi> and <hi>magnificence</hi> which ſuit ſo <hi>ill</hi> with the Characters of the Croſs. I confeſs at the Firſt glance it might ſtartle any one, were it not that a multitude of perſons, both
<pb facs="tcp:54442:4"/> Illuſtrious in <hi>Blood,</hi> and eminent in <hi>Sanctity,</hi> have taught by their Example, that the <hi>glittering</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and a <hi>penitential Heart</hi> are not things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible:</hi> It were to groap in the <hi>Sun-beams</hi> to play the Ignorant in this <hi>Truth,</hi> that is, not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that in all ages ſince Chriſt's viſible appearance upon Earth, <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> of no leſs extraction have been found, who under a Cloth of <hi>Tyſſue,</hi> and the richeſt Ornaments have covered their <hi>tender Bodies</hi> with <hi>Hair-cloths:</hi> Who amidſt the delicacies of the <hi>Court,</hi> have macerated themſelves with <hi>faſting,</hi> and ſeaſoned their <hi>repaſts</hi> with bitter ingredients: VVho have more valued <hi>one hours</hi> entertainment between <hi>God</hi> and their happy <hi>Souls,</hi> than all the <hi>Balls</hi> and <hi>Maſques</hi> to which external compliance the greatneſs of their condition in ſome ſort obliged them. For the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of <hi>pennance</hi> conſiſts in the interiour diſpoſition of the Mind; that is, in the operation of the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> and <hi>will.</hi> The <hi>underſtanding</hi> firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents unto us a God diſobeyed, and ſcorned; and his <hi>Juſtice</hi> (by this indignity ſtirred up to vindicate his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor) threatning nothing but ruine and deſolation in this diſtreſs, the <hi>underſtanding</hi> further ſuggeſts that we have no <hi>refuge</hi> but to the throne of <hi>mercy,</hi> whereupon the <hi>will</hi> falls to work, laments what is paſſed, proteſts againſt any future complyance with bad inclinations, and ſeiſed with a holy <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>affliction,</hi> ſubmits to any compenſation ſhall be required: Theſe are the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratories to <hi>juſtification,</hi> and when once they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
<pb facs="tcp:54442:4"/> by a ray of <hi>Faith,</hi> ſtrengthened with <hi>hope,</hi> and animated with <hi>charity,</hi> this vertue of <hi>pennance</hi> growes up to that efficacy, as to obtain, in conſideration of the excellency of its acts, and fervency of the Agent a <hi>full remiſſion</hi> of all ſin: Whence it is evident this grand work of <hi>pennance</hi> may be wrought within the precincts of our interiour, and conſequently the vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>precious attyre,</hi> and ceremonies of <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> may poſsibly reach only to the <hi>film</hi> or <hi>out-ſide,</hi> whileſt within they poſſeſs <hi>humility, purity, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and other Chriſtian vertues.</p>
            <p>To give a further elucidation of this point, you will pleaſe <hi>Madam</hi> to know, that Chriſt our Lord in his <hi>copious Redemption</hi> had <hi>two</hi> main <hi>deſigns:</hi> The <hi>one</hi> to gain the <hi>Hearts</hi> of Men to the obedience of his <hi>Lawes,</hi> which were ſo frozen and marble like as he foreſaw a ſlight wound received upon their ſcore would have little effect; wherefore he uſed all the endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>motives</hi> imaginable to work them to their <hi>duty,</hi> and what greater than to receive upon his Back the <hi>ſtripes</hi> due to anothers tranſgreſsion. It is related of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the great, that he never beheld the pourtraiture of <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Arm lifted up to Sacrifice <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but it drew <hi>Tears</hi> from him; and for us to behold the <hi>Eternal Father</hi> abandoning his own and <hi>only Son</hi> to all the outrages which accurſed miſcreants could inflict upon him, without any reſentment of our obligations, eſpecially ſince they were directed to lead us into the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>eternal felicity,</hi> is certainly a <hi>wonder</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb facs="tcp:54442:5"/> all the prodigies he ever wrought, we ſee that very <hi>Tygers</hi> are won by the unreſiſtable power of good turns; wherefore Chriſt our Lord hoped by this Engin to make a breach into us, and if once he made an <hi>Entry</hi> into our <hi>Hearts,</hi> he knew we would preſently <hi>Capitulate,</hi> and ſurrender at leaſt with <hi>colours flying;</hi> that is, conform our ſelves to his commands though upon the large <hi>Articles</hi> of enjoying many ſenſual pleaſures, which his indulgent Rules allow to the more Earthy part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Beſides this <hi>rational deſign</hi> of working us to a Complyance with his <hi>precepts,</hi> he had yet another more ſublime in his ſuperabundant <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> which was to teach us the Law of <hi>love;</hi> now this is an Enemy to mercenary aims, and carryes us beyond the Crude <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of doing no more than what is preciſely command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us his drift in this ſo rigorous a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of our debts, <hi>that</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>we might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and trace his ſteps.</hi> For he knew this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive way ſo neceſſary to us, as things now ſtand after our corruption in ſin, that albeit <hi>one groan</hi> of his had been <hi>ſufficient</hi> through the dignity of his infinite perſon to have redeemed a million of Worlds, yet he was content to load himſelf with all the injuries that Man can endure, believing his <hi>commands</hi> would prove leſs <hi>efficacious</hi> than the model and pattern of an <hi>immenſe love,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented lively unto us in his own actions.</p>
            <p>It is ſtoried of a <hi>King</hi> amongſt the <hi>Grecians,</hi> that he had a <hi>perſon</hi> very deformed, as it could not but

            <p>This little Treatiſe <hi>Madam,</hi> is grounded upon a famous Preſident to publiſh to the world what <hi>pennance</hi> can do: It ſets before our Eyes a <hi>King</hi> who had great failings, but by <hi>penitential acts</hi> he ſo redeemed them, as I queſtion whether <hi>ſucceeding ages</hi> gained not more by his <hi>misfortunes,</hi> than if he had never loſt his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence;</hi> and as it is ſaid of the incredulous Apoſtle, that his <hi>ſlow belief</hi> cleared to us all <hi>miſts of doubt,</hi> ſo the <hi>miſcarriages</hi> of our great <hi>Penitent</hi> warn us both of our own <hi>weakneſs,</hi> not to truſt to our ſelves in <hi>dangerous occaſions,</hi> as alſo of God's <hi>enclining mercy</hi> ſo to ſhield us from <hi>deſpair.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the firſt entrance our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet prefers his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and without any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution expreſſes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect terms what he would have, <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, have mercy on me, O God;</hi> and he do's it with ſuch confidence as if he had a right to be forgiven: which minds me of a rare ſentence of S. <hi>Gregory Niſſen;</hi> that Man cannot more willingly ask pardon, than God is ready to give it: The Divine Majeſty expects (if it may be ſo expreſs'd) with paſſion the converſion of a ſinner, and no ſooner a repenting motion animates his heart, but the whole Court of heaven is alarmed with joy, and this joy is followed with showers of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: No wonder then if our Petitioner make his addreſs with ſo little Ceremony, ſince
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54442:8"/> he ſpeaks to a Judge reſolved to mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſubmiſſion; to a Father who is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with joy at the ſight of his long loſt Son: to a Creatour who hath framed every particle of his being, and perfectly knows how frail, weak, and prone to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable failings he is (if left to himſelf) wherefore he cryes <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, have mercy on me, O God.</hi> He shelters this guilty (me) t'wixt God that made him, and Mercy that muſt ſave him; on theſe two he anchors all his hopes, which being let down by a vigorous faith renders him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure amidſt all the ſtorms, that hell and earth can raiſe; ſo that now like a rock he ſtands braving all his enemies aſſaults, who not long before was handed like a ball from one pleaſure to another, as if he had been made up of ſenſuality, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a neglect of God.</p>
               <p>Next in this exordium our Petitioner would inſinuate a great truth, that the firſt grace is a free gift of God, and man a veſſel of mercy, not of merit; hence he cryes <hi>Miſerere mei Deus,</hi> that is to ſay, let him pine away in ſorrow, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, let him produce acts of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent affection, by which he prizes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54442:8"/> God above all things imaginable, yet when all this is done, he is a Child of perdition, and clouded with the guilt of Sin, unleſs an act of Grace be made him from his Sovereign: Wherefore we muſt know that <hi>Grace expelling Sin</hi> by acceſs unto the Soul, finds there no <hi>merit,</hi> nothing that can pretend to a <hi>juſtification;</hi> neither Faith nor any other Vertue ſtrikes the ſtroak, ſince Grace is the <hi>baſis,</hi> or ground-work of all <hi>merit,</hi> whence its being is derived no leſs than a beauteous Flower from the Plant that gives it birth: This piece of Divinity lay not hid to our <hi>penitent,</hi> hence he acknowledges his imbecility in <hi>meriting</hi> any favour, only he ſtrives by holy acts of love, and grief to diſpoſe himſelf for, <hi>mercy:</hi> Nay though he should comfort himſelf with <hi>Nathan</hi>'s words that he was already poſſeſſed of the firſt Grace, yet to perſevere in it, ſo as not to fall again, he knew muſt be the work of the ſame merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hand; for it is no leſs out of our reach to become <hi>juſt,</hi> than to remain ſo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſtant ſupply of many actual Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which muſt iſſue <hi>gratis</hi> from Heaven: This kept him ſtill in humility, as never to preſume of his own ſtrength, alwayes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54442:9"/> in fear, without any ſecurity of happineſs in this life: So that having throughly ſcann'd the Condition of Man in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, he concludes, the beſt leſſon ſuitable to our continual wants here, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly to repeat, and entreat under this effectual form, <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on me, O God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whil'ſt he thus layes all his hopes at the feet of <hi>mercy,</hi> he cannot but bleſs the ſweet proceedings of Heaven, in requiring of us to compaſs our <hi>happineſs,</hi> that which is ſo conformable both to our Reaſon and Nature: For can there be any thing more <hi>rational,</hi> and delightful to Man, than to love a Sovereign Good, to congratulate the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence, Divine Subſiſtences, Divine Attributes, and unchangeable perfections eſſentially ſeated in God; Can there be any thing more <hi>juſt,</hi> than to deſire this greatneſs and goodneſs should have his Divine Laws fulfilled, the Univerſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the Encreaſe and Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Service, and that all praiſe and Benediction be poured forth before him by all Creatures both in Heaven and Earth: Can there be any action more <hi>commendable</hi> than to conceive an extream
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54442:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> deteſtation of Sin, becauſe injurious to His Supream Majeſty, and obſtructive to his glory; and yet in doing this, we ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper our ſelves for the reception of his favours, that as in the Order of Natural things, upon the <hi>Organization,</hi> and fitted Diſpoſitions of a <hi>Body,</hi> he hath obliged himſelf to infuſe a <hi>Soul,</hi> ſo he hath no leſs engaged to veſt that Mind with ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grace, which by acts of love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance shall be prepared for it.</p>
               <p>But alas! Amidſt theſe pleaſing reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when he looks into himſelf he finds a check, ſeeing he cannot even diſpoſe himſelf for this happineſs without a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural aid;</hi> for though 'tis true humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by its own ſtrength knowes that God is worthy of all love, yet our knowledge in morality is much more capable of <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion</hi> than <hi>practice:</hi> 'Tis not enough to have Wings to fly, if they be ſo hamper'd as they cannot be diſplay'd; ſo this natural facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Man of loving God above all things is ſo weakned by original Sin, and a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of Obſtacles, that we find the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of doing it far more ineffectual, than the <hi>dictamens</hi> of our reaſon to have it done. And no wonder when St. <hi>Thomas</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54442:10"/> affirms, our <hi>Will</hi> by original Sin, is much more damnified than our <hi>underſtanding,</hi> whence ſelf love growes powerful in us, and if it hath not a counterpoiſe of <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> ſuccours, we are violently hurried into the purſuit of Fading, and ſenſible objects. This conſideration makes our <hi>penitent</hi> deplore the miſeries of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo wounded and made impotent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good, as of her ſelf she cannot pay what she owes to the moſt lawful <hi>object of all hearts,</hi> for his juſt homages are not only Sighs, Groans, and Enthuſiaſtick throwes, but effective ſervices; as the exact obſervance of his commands, an averſion from what may put a ſeparation 'twixt <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Soul,</hi> ſuch are ſenſual pleaſures, greatneſs in the World and honours in exceſs, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over Temptations, and in many en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters this love exacts a perpeſſion of all the Calamities to which Man is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, even to the privation of life, that he may not fall into tranſgreſſions oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto it: And theſe difficulties do ſo far exceed humane imbecility, that at laſt he makes this reſult, he muſt ſtick cloſe to his praeliminary addreſs, <hi>miſerere mei Deus, have mercy on me O God;</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54442:10"/>
               <p>Again, when he reflects on the diſtance of theſe Terms <hi>Deus &amp; mei, God and me,</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks it should ſtartle the greateſt Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to conſider the <hi>ſublimity</hi> of him that is offended, and the <hi>deſpicability</hi> of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour; the <hi>one</hi> is immenſe and fills all places, the <hi>other</hi> is contracted into the dimenſions of a ſmall Body; the <hi>one</hi> is immutable, and ſtill the ſame, the <hi>other</hi> is corruptible, and mouldring away every Moment towards that nothing from whence it came; the <hi>one</hi> is eternal, the <hi>other</hi> ſubject to time; the <hi>one</hi> is the object of Beatitude, the <hi>other</hi> of Miſery: 'Tis true our <hi>penitent</hi> in relation to earthly greatneſs was qualified with the higheſt Title the World can give, as being <hi>Sovereign Monarch,</hi> and <hi>ſole Ruler</hi> of a cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Nation, a vaſt and numerous Body of People; yet if compared to God, he is not ſo much as an <hi>Atome</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Sun:</hi> And for this <hi>me,</hi> this nothing to riſe up in rebellion againſt ſuch a Sovereign, it muſt needs work a ſtrange Confuſion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance within him how to make his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; <hi>on the one ſide</hi> dejected by his own unworthineſs, <hi>on the other,</hi> dazled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by the glory of the incenſed. Yet at laſt he breaks through all obſtacles, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54442:11"/> implores <hi>mercy,</hi> he had rather perish in <hi>hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> too much, than to commit a Sacriledge in <hi>diſtruſting</hi> the goodneſs of him who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites all without diſtinction unto him: Nay I believe, had the object againſt which he treſpaſſed, been any thing leſs than God, he would never have opened his Lips in Order to a Remiſſion: For he knew well that he only <hi>to whom Goodneſs and Mercy is eſſential,</hi> would or could oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his guilt. 'Tis true his power and greatneſs ſtrike a terrour, yet they are ſo contempered with a merciful ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that the <hi>Blackeſt Soul</hi> may there find wherewith to rinſe her <hi>ſtains,</hi> and exchange them for a pure Dye of <hi>innocency,</hi> if she can with a <hi>Davids</hi> Heart and Tongue but iſſue forth <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, have mercy on me O God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I obſerve moreover that Almighty God permits a Soul though very dear unto him, to be often here expoſed in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where she ſeems to be wholly loſt, and abandoned; that Heaven appears to have <hi>no light</hi> for her, and the Earth nothing but <hi>malice</hi> to work her ruine: How many terrors, and anxieties of Mind have Saints endured, and been left without any glimps
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54442:11"/> of Comfort, even for ſome whole year: And why all theſe rude tryals in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the moſt innocent Soul, but that God ſeems to be delighted when his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures tune forth; <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, have mercy on me O God:</hi> Whence you may ſee, that God will exempt no condition from this <hi>ſupplicating ſtile,</hi> he will be ſued to by the innocent, as well as nocent, and where the Formality of malice is wanting, he oft gives the apprehenſion, to the end, that flying to this powerful <hi>miſerere,</hi> they might draw at leaſt from his Goodnſs the benefits of Converſation, encreaſe of Grace, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Vertue, and other innumerable Mercies which he hath in ſtore for thoſe who truſt in him. So that there is no time, nor place unſeaſonable for any perſon to prefer this Petition; <hi>Miſerere mei Deus, have mercy on me O God.</hi>

                  <p>By this Petition we are taught not to preſume on the value of our own actions: For God is the Sovereign Lord of the whole World, and particularly of the <hi>juſt,</hi> all whoſe good works convey unto him a

Let the <hi>juſt</hi> perform all the good imaginable, in return he may juſtly ſay, I accept theſe ſervices in diſcharge of your paſt debts, and what you owe me for your Creation, Conſervation, and the Grace I have given you to act: So that we may truly ſay with St. <hi>Paul, when we have done all we can, we are uſeleſs Servants:</hi> For whereas we were pure Negatives, it was his Sole Mercy that extracted us from nothing; it was this ſame Mercy which added to our natural Being, a Being of Grace.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54442:13"/> to anſwer one word for a thouſand:</hi> Therefore he caſts himſelf wholly upon the Favour of his judge, ſaying, <hi>Secundùm magnam miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diam tuam, according to thy great mercy:</hi> He ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all the other Divine Attributes, and conjures his Creatour by that which ſeems moſt appropriated to his condition.</p>
               <p>Nor is he content to challenge his <hi>mercy</hi> without the ſpecification of <hi>great mercy,</hi> as if the Enormity of his Crimes were ſuch as required more than an Ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donation.</p>
               <p>Indeed his Mercy may well be ſtiled <hi>great,</hi> for it hath all the dimenſions of greatneſs, it reacheth from Heaven to Earth, even to the Gates of Hell: It is extended from one pole to another, nay it is immenſe as God himſelf, participating of his Divine nature; it ſearches the abſtruſeſt corners of our Heart, and if the leaſt <hi>Crany</hi> be put open to his light, and grace, it is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly replenished by this <hi>great mercy.</hi> Ah! did we but know what miſts of terrene affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the beams of his mercy have diſperſed within us; what a change they have made in our bad inclinations, what dangers they have met and diverted from us: We should even repine at Nature that hath
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54442:13"/> not furnished us with more Hearts, and Tongues to love and praiſe this <hi>great mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He adds likewiſe <hi>ſecundùm,</hi> that is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtome of thy <hi>great mercy,</hi> which uſes not to boggle at the remiſſion of any ſin, nor to look ſo preciſely upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the offendours paſt malice, as upon his <hi>preſent repentance,</hi> whence he grounds the Communication of his Grace; by which we may diſcern the Senſe our Holy King had of his tranſgreſſions, which made him willing to huddle up his ſcore, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving in any particular to deſire they migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>We are taught by this two things, Firſt not to <hi>preſume</hi> upon the value of our own actions, ſo farr as from them to juſtifie our ſelves; for in this kind none could plead more for himſelf than our <hi>holy petitioner;</hi> he had with a Piety and fortitude unequalled run through many difficult, and glorious enterpriſes, wherein God was pleaſed to appear for him, and own him his champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Yet he thinks good to hush up all this, well knowing that praiſe is due alone to him under whoſe guidance and protection
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54442:14"/> he had begun, and ſet a fortunate period to them.</p>
               <p>Next we are taught that (reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſins paſt) we should never deſpair; for as our <hi>good deeds</hi> we owe to God alone, by whoſe inſpiration moving us we do them; ſo we muſt ſubmit our <hi>bad deeds</hi> (whereof we our ſelves are the ſole Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) to his Mercy: Whence we may ſee, though he cannot concurr with us in doing ill, his unſpotted Nature being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any obliquity; yet it being done, he will share with us in the undoing, or repairing of our misfortunes: And which is more, no ſooner hath this M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

It is this great Mercy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end, or beginning, which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed from all eternity to bring us off clear from all miſery, and place us glorious in his light inacceſſible; from the time that God was, and loved himſelf, he diſpoſed us for his love, and mercy; have we not therefore reaſon to ſpend every moment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54442:14"/> of our Life in loving, praiſing, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying this <hi>great mercy:</hi> It is in all kinds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, no exceſs of malice obſtructs it, no frequency of Commiſſion or reiterated guilt renders it inexorable, no time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes it, no not a deſperate delay to the laſt moment, O God thy judgments may be well ſaid to be <hi>unfathomed Abyſſes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are loſt our moſt <hi>Enormous crimes,</hi> and from that loſs we find our ſelves transferred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the enjoyance of thee, irradiated with the comfortable beams of thy mercy.</p>
               <p>But above all, this mercy never appears ſo great as in the admirable Myſtery of the Incarnation, where we behold the eternal Father giving up his only Son in behalf of Mankind vitiated, and defiled with Sin, rebellious, and inſolent againſt His Sovereign, a Worm, and poor ſcantling of putrefaction, a prey for the Flames of Hell: That, I ſay, a God moſt perfect in himſelf, who hath no want, should love ſo vile a Creature, at ſuch a diſtance from him, and who could ſtand him in no ſtead: and yet this eternal God full of greatneſs hath cherished Man in ſuch a manner, as to beſtow upon him the dear production of himſelf, coeternal, conſubſtantial, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54442:15"/> equal to him in Greatneſs and Majeſty, and for what end? To ſave him from ruine, to enrich him with eternal Life; this is that <hi>great mercy</hi> our Penitent now implores, and he claims it by vertue of a promiſe made to <hi>Abraham;</hi> that ſince he had not grudged him his only Sonne, all Nations should be bleſſed in his Seed, that the Eternal Death of him who is <hi>temporal,</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by the temporal Death of him who is <hi>eternal:</hi> How many Miracles found birth in the execution of this act of love and mercy: Firſt, Nature was ſtopt as to the reſult of a humane ſubſiſtence, in whoſe place was intimately applyed the <hi>perſonality</hi> of the Divine word; and this infinite ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, was adorned with graces, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and priviledges ſupereminent; a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enjoyed a <hi>fruitful Virginity,</hi> and a <hi>delivery</hi> without pain; in the <hi>fruit</hi> was found at the ſame inſtant the blood conſolidated, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized, animated, and deifyed: So that the <hi>Second Perſon</hi> of the bleſſed Trinity aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a new Being newly produced, that is, the <hi>eſſence of a holy humanity,</hi> attyred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with it, becomes a <hi>good man,</hi> and a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter piece of love, and mercy: A remedy ſo neceſſary, that without it all the purity

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54442:17"/> that many have been ſaved in his condition; how ſome have been caſt upon the shore, others upon a Rock, ſome by a paſſing Boat gathered up: <hi>In fine</hi> he calls to mind a thouſand wayes of preſervation to conſolate himſelf in this diſtreſs, and every thought of hope makes him graſp with new fervour his floating ſupport: Even ſo I may ſay of our diſtreſſed Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, his goodly Veſſel of <hi>innocence</hi> was wreck'd, dashed againſt the powerfull <hi>charms</hi> of a Woman, from thence he was thrown into an Ocean of Sins, where on all ſides he beheld the menaces of eternal deſtruction; in theſe perplexities he runs with his thought over all the paſſages of God's mercy from the World's beginning by the conſideration of them, a little to keep up his ſinking Spirits. He fails not to remember the mild proceeding of God with <hi>Adam</hi> in not punishing him irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably, as he had done the reprobate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, but was contented to <hi>Exile</hi> him from the delicious place of his Creation, and to <hi>expoſe</hi> him here to the Whirl-winds of paſſions, in which conteſt if he proved faithful; his reward was to be the ſame as firſt deſigned for him: From thence he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54442:18"/> paſſes to the conflagration of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> where though God's juſtice fell heavy upon thoſe miſcreants, yet he layes it on their <hi>impenitency,</hi> and admires his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> that would notwithſtanding have kept in his shafts of vengeance for the ſake of <hi>ten</hi> juſt perſons; if that ſmall number were but found in thoſe populous Cities; he goes on to the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> and pleaſes himſelf to ſee them under the Lee born thitherby <hi>repentance,</hi> even when the ſtorm of God's wrath was ready to plunge them in an <hi>Abyſs</hi> of ruine: He inſiſts much upon the prayer of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ſtill diverted the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deſigns of God upon his people; he fancies that every Groan and Sigh of his contributes ſomething towards the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up of a <hi>brazen Serpent,</hi> by whoſe Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign aſpect his cauterized Soul might be unvenomed and made whole. It was no ſmall Conſolation when he reflects on God's people in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whoſe Oppreſſion (which their own Sins had drawn upon them) was yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved at the rate of miracles, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſuch as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had not ſeen: And why all this? But to make good his promiſe to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54442:18"/> would never abandon a <hi>Truly-repenting</hi> Heart.</p>
               <p>Thus he goes on enumerating a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other paſſages of God's mercy from the Worlds Creation, until his time; nor is he content with this, but advances fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diſplaying in his prophetick know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, innumerable other effects of God's compaſſion to Mankind, and at laſt begins to make this Application, though he could not deſerve to partake of his <hi>great mercy,</hi> that is, not only to have his guilt remitted, but alſo to become the object of his choiceſt favours, yet at leaſt he hoped he might be hudled in amidſt the multitude of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>How ſweetly did thoſe Attributes Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine reſound in his Ears, where God is ſtiled <hi>rich in mercies,</hi> where his Mercy tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends all his other works, and where his Goodneſs and Mercy are proclaimed <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted Sources:</hi> He leaves not a <hi>Crany</hi> in the World unranſacked, and after the ſevereſt ſcrutiny finds, and confeſſes there is no place deſtitute of his mercy, no Creature that is not cheered, and enlivened by the effects of his mercy; this made him cry: <hi>Lord when thou doſt open thy hand, all Creatures are
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54442:19"/> filled with bleſsings; and he tells us that every Being looks upwards depending on his Creatour, and expects from him a ſeaſonable ſupply of all wants:</hi> Nay he excludes not Hell, nor Souls doom'd to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal flames from this mercy, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that God is <hi>bonus univerſis, good to all,</hi> and though his <hi>Juſtice</hi> have plunged them in that Calamitous State of <hi>miſery,</hi> yet that their <hi>torments</hi> are not more intenſe, and in many circumſtances aggravated, they owe it to his <hi>mercy,</hi> which ſtill hath ſomething to do, even in the punishment of the higheſt offendours.</p>
               <p>Having then ſurvey'd Angels, Man, and ſenſible Creatures, the Heavens, Earth, and Hell, and found no Being that could in the leaſt repine for want of mercy; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe reflections with juſt reaſon our <hi>Petitioner</hi> entitles them a <hi>multitude of mercies,</hi> for on all ſides they flow as from a natural Source. Nor wonder that we have more Preſidents of his mercy than Juſtice, for the one conſiſts in a communicative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of what is good, and as God is <hi>eſſentially good,</hi> ſo he can alwayes breath forth theſe emanations of his goodneſs upon us: Now Juſtice, though it be equally eſſential to the Divine Eſſence with mercy, and other
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54442:19"/> Attributes, yet in its operations <hi>ad extra</hi> or exteriour effects, it depends upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity of our actions, without which it hath no matter or Subject to work on: So that <hi>mercy</hi> he can alwayes shower down upon us, but <hi>Juſtice</hi> only when we <hi>offend:</hi> he would not forget how the greater number of Angels ſtood the brunt of temptations, when <hi>Lucifer</hi> perished with his proud ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, it was this mercy held them up at the inſtant of their Tryal; and though our <hi>afflicted penitent</hi> found not this innocence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving mercy, yet he hopes to lay hold on that part where he is ſtiled a <hi>purifying mercy:</hi> Let his Subjects fall from their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and throw curſes at him, let his Children prove unnatural, and labour to dethrone him, let a peſtilential Diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populate his Country; <hi>in fine</hi> let the Joy of his Life <hi>Abſalom</hi> be ſacrificed by the Hand of his own Souldier, with ſmiles he will paſs through all theſe Teſts, ſo they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the hand of this all purifying mercy: He values not the <hi>mediums,</hi> but the end he tends to, and when he thinks o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54442:20"/> and furtherance of a ſinners converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in thoſe immenſe felicities he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates by his preſence: For here he beholds a <hi>God</hi> courting his Creatures, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible as it were of injuries, and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours from them, and ſeconding their leaſt good intents, with the powerful ſuccours of <hi>grace.</hi> There he contemplates a God remunerating our ſmall inconſiderable Acts of Vertue with the ſame Felicity, wherewith he himſelf is bleſt and made happy: For his <hi>Beatitude</hi> is to enjoy himſelf and contemplate his own beauty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and this ſame <hi>Beatitude</hi> he imparts to us poor worms through the <hi>exceſs</hi> of his Mercy. But whether our <hi>holy penitent</hi> more extolls the effects of his mercies in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth I know not; yet of this I am ſure, he is reconciled to make it whilſt he hath life, the Theam of his Pen, Heart, and Tongue; he will celebrate the praiſes of his innumerable mercies for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he hath ſcarce a Pſalm which ſpeaks not his zeal for this ſubject, as if his quill had been dipped in this Fountain of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <p>Another branch which growes up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the multitude of his mercies, is, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54442:20"/> he diſtributes his bleſſings not ſo much in the meaſure of his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> as <hi>love;</hi> and after his innumerable favours done to his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, he defies the whole Maſs of Creatures to tax him of any want on his part: For should he reward us according to our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which he in his praeſcience and eternal eſſence foreſees will come to paſs, who of us should be left alive, or who of us should be born? Only the <hi>innocent</hi> should then be favoured, and rather than it should be ſo, he was willing to put it upon the Tryal, how or what we might prove hereafter. He foreknew that <hi>Lucifer</hi> should fall, that <hi>Adam</hi> would ſin, <hi>Saul</hi> become diſobedient, and <hi>Judas</hi> betray him, yet he forbare not (for all this) to throw his favours upon them; to shew his <hi>mercy</hi> is ever in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with Man's <hi>malice,</hi> and like a good Phyſitian if <hi>one</hi> Medicine work no good, he applyes <hi>another</hi> like a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Let every one examine his life from the time he had the uſe of reaſon, and I am confident he will find many tyes of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to this great mercy; nay amongſt the maſs of Chriſtians, I believe there is none but ranks himſelf a favourite in order to his largeſſes of mercy: For his love is conſtant, and knowes no change, this great and good God hath perſiſted for an infinity of time in the perpetual reſolution of gratifying us with his gifts, his enflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart hath entertained a continual ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude without any truce for our good. Witneſs the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> who ſayes that <hi>God hath loved us with an everlaſting Charity:</hi> His love is eternal, having alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to enrich us with his favours; St. <hi>Paul</hi> proclaims it, <hi>that he hath loved us before the World was framed.</hi> It is diſintereſſed, without any advantage to himſelf or hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn on our parts: No other motive than the ſuperabundance of his goodneſs; like a <hi>fountain</hi> which runs over, his <hi>natural good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> throwes bleſſings on all Creatures. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaking of love, ſayes, <hi>it takes any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54442:22"/> occaſion be it never ſo ſlight, to oblige the beloved; he wants no baits, nor ſnares, carrying about him the matter of his own bondage:</hi> So God's love ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver takes leave of a Sinner; nay where Man's impiety extorts as it were from him the darts of his Juſtice, he ſeems preſently to relent, and promiſes (as he did after the Deluge) to do ſo no more; ſo that his love being eternal, unchangeable, and deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all ſelf ends, what can we ask of God that iſſues not from his <hi>mercy,</hi> wherefore let us with holy <hi>David</hi> cry <hi>have mercy on us O God, according to the multitude of thy mercies.</hi>

               <p>OUr poor Criminal having thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his <hi>Judge,</hi> the next care is to lay open his <hi>condition,</hi> and shew he implores God's purifying Mercy, by whoſe vertue the Chains of our ſins are looſened and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54442:22"/> diſſolved: Nor did it a little raiſe his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that his Judge was not tyed up to Lawes, as the Ground-work of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with offendours; but his power is abſolute to do all he pleaſes, and his will ſuch as to render what ever he doe's good, and Juſt: So that the <hi>leaſt propenſion</hi> of this Will; in order to a remiſſion, is ſufficient to wipe away all the iniquities of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he conſiders that when God chaſtiſes, he doth a thing extraneous to him, and (as <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaies) a work that is not his: But to be merciful he owns it as a propriety annexed to his Godhead, not to extenuate his Juſtice, but to inſinuate the love he bears to Man.</p>
               <p>He embroyls not his Fancy with the niceties in Schools; which diſpute how Sin is remitted, whether by the expulſion of any poſitive form, and the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another oppoſite to it: Whether it be by the meer infuſion of Grace, or elſe only by taking away the obligation of a Sinner to eternal puniſhment; he omits all theſe curious queſtions, and attends only to the ſweet effect, to wit, that he may be freed from his iniquity, oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54442:23"/> in his Heart, he had rather be a <hi>good Diſciple,</hi> than a <hi>great Maſter</hi> in the exact knowledge of his own miſery.</p>
               <p>When he looks back into his life paſt, and remembers with what ſatisfaction, and ſpiritual joy he had performed many acts of vertue, he begins to be enfired with new flames of urging for a grant of his Petition: Since he knowes that whilſt he lyes under this attaindour of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> he is capable of no <hi>right</hi> nor <hi>priviledge,</hi> in the Charter given us by Heaven, that should he do actions which in another condition might be praemiated, would now be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a Jewel counterfeit and of no value: He compares himſelf to a <hi>Plant</hi> in a Region far remote from the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Fruit never comes to maturity, ſo his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſets <hi>him</hi> at a great diſtance with <hi>God,</hi> the light and life of Souls, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing can be expected from him which ſavours not of a Soyl accurſed, and doom'd to ſterility; ſo that as a misfortune ſeldome walks ſolitary, he finds beſides the unhappineſs to have offended God, this addition, to be unable to do any thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto him.</p>
               <p>Then he goes on ruminating upon the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54442:23"/> ſad conſequences of his Sin, which makes him fluctuate in his thoughts, wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved how to comport himſelf: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he appears like a <hi>Statue</hi> without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would eternally remain ſo, ſince by no endeavours he can pleaſe his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: Then again I behold him bent upon the execution of all the good imaginable, at leaſt within the extent of his natural Force or Power; that he may omit no Homage and Duty he owes to the Author of his Being: But after all his reſtleſs ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudes, he obſerves the <hi>main Hinge</hi> of his happineſs depends upon this <hi>Dele iniquitatem,</hi> the cancelling of this Bond by which he is lyable to eternal punishment, e're he can hope for admittance unto his wonted ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing entertainments with his Divine Maſter.</p>
               <p>He deſcants upon the proceeding of Almighty God with Sinners, and would feign ſearch into the ſecrets of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, why ſome are drawn from the depth of wickedneſs; even when they ſeemed to be loſt to the World and Heaven, whilſt others leſs guilty in the Eyes of men ſadly perish without ſource, or redreſs. The preſervation of the one he attributes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54442:24"/> to the <hi>immenſe goodneſs</hi> of God, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſpenſes (as juſtly he may) in his own lawes, as to afford unto an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſinner ſuch powerfull calls that they are never reſiſted; ſuch melting affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if they had been train'd up in the School of <hi>Divine love,</hi> not in the Forge of <hi>iniquity:</hi> It is fit (he confeſſes) the Divine Will which frames all Creatures, should ſo diſpoſe of what he hath made, that when he pleaſes to raiſe any one out of <hi>corruption,</hi> and render them <hi>inſtrumental</hi> to his Glory, none ought, or can juſtly repine at it: He ſuſtains this Argument with much heat, himſelf being a party intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſtill expecting to be the object of his choice mercy: He dilates and expands his Soul under this inexhauſted ſource, like the Earth without Water thirſting for <hi>one drop</hi> of that Coeleſtial ſtream which might allay the <hi>anguiſh</hi> of his Mind, and deface all the foul Characters of his iniquity; his groans, and unwearied ſighs are fair Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of that Noble Gueſt he once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, with unſpeakable delight, and if he ever gain the repoſſeſſion, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts that neither Angels, Men, Devils, nor all the charmes in Creatures shall ever
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54442:24"/> brand him with a new ſtamp of iniquity: <hi>his Eyes</hi> by which his Soul receiv'd her firſt wound are become <hi>two floods of tears,</hi> and if they prevail not to cleanſe his <hi>ſtains,</hi> at leaſt they will teſtifie to the World, he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what he had done: He caſts not one glance towards Heaven which is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with hopes of meeting this mercy, and this confidence is ſo ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, that were it decreed God would ſave but <hi>one Soul,</hi> he hath courage enough to hope that <hi>his</hi> might be <hi>that one;</hi> nay he builds ſo much upon theſe hopes, that tranſporting himſelf to the conſideration of many Sinners, abandoned in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, it doth not at all deject him; for he conſiders that God hath given us a <hi>free-will,</hi> which he will never violence to our prejudice, and though we cannot elevate this will to <hi>an act</hi> ſo perfect as naturally to merit the <hi>firſt Grace;</hi> yet it may in ſuch ſort diſpoſe us for grace by love, and ſorrow; that God will doubtleſs gratifie us ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared: Whence 'tis clear, that as we fall not but by our own default, ſo by vertue of a promiſe, and contract made by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we cannot finally perish but by an obſtinate reluctancy of our own Hearts:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54442:25"/> If he ſees a <hi>Phararh</hi> ſink into ruine irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably, he beholds likewiſe a <hi>Nebuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozer</hi> for the ſame crime ſtruck down, to riſe again: They were both <hi>Kings,</hi> the ſin of either alike, detaining God's people in captivity, yet the Fates of both very une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual: Becauſe the one <hi>retracts</hi> his miſdeeds, and raiſes a deteſtation of them, the other <hi>perſiſts</hi> in his Enormities without any truce or ſuſpenſion.</p>
               <p>At laſt he makes a Corollary of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and concludes, ſince <hi>ſome</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Innocence by continued showers of Grace, <hi>others</hi> by a ſweet violence drawn from an <hi>Abyſs</hi> of Sin to the upshot of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and none ſo entangled, whom a true repentance will not ſet free; he will never ceaſe <hi>to importune Heaven</hi> till his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be raſed out: let his <hi>Throat</hi> grow hoarſe with clamours, his Eyes droop and wax dimme, his <hi>Heart</hi> rend aſunder with grief, he will ſpare no Particle of his whole Body, nay glory in its ruine, if by that means he can but unclog his Soul from the weight of Sin: He judged it very reaſonable, that the Body having contributed to his Sin, should share in the <hi>puniſhment,</hi> as it had done in the <hi>crime,</hi> and as it had concurred unto
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54442:25"/> his <hi>miſery,</hi> ſo likewiſe it might unto his <hi>happineſs:</hi> For doubtleſs the Combats which a virtuous Man ſuſtains amidſt ſo many Head-ſtrong paſſions which abound in this mortal frame of ours, are no ſmall advancements to eternal Glory, nor mean Engins to work our Freedom from the ſlavery of Sin: Hence he takes up arms, proclaims Warr againſt himſelf, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures any future compliance with his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled appetite: He will make his Body a Sacrifice into pennance, which before had been a lump of ordures, and ſenſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: His <hi>will</hi> shall become a Tyrant, and check every the leaſt inclination to Evil, which till then was agitated and born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with every breath of Vanity, and foul delights; and if withall theſe rigours he can break the ſtamp of his iniquity, he will prize that Action, beyond all his former Victories, and raiſe more Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies in Memory of this deliverance than ever were conſecrated to the moſt Heroick enterprize of any perſon in the World.</p>
               <p>The <hi>monſtrous ſhape</hi> of his iniquity ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded him, that 'till it was defaced, he could not ask any bleſſing; for it is the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54442:26"/> greateſt of evils, and wherein all misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes are Centered. When <hi>Rheuben</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned his Father <hi>Jacob</hi> that <hi>Benjamin</hi> his darling might go into <hi>Egypt,</hi> he offered his two Sons as pledges for his return, and adds for a further engagement, <hi>ero peccati reus,</hi> he would be guilty of ſin, that is, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to all the miſeries imaginable, if he falſifyed his word. St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſing how ſeverely God fell upon his only Son, ſayes he, <hi>who knew no ſin, was made ſin for us;</hi> that is, he diſcharged upon him the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of his wrath, rendring him the moſt deſpicable of Men, as a Teſtimony of ſins deformity, and the deplorable State of him that lyes under the guilt of a mortal tranſgreſſion: Whence a great Doctor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the truth of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s aſſertion that <hi>one drop</hi> of the water of Paradiſe will be ſufficient to quench the <hi>flames of Hell,</hi> yet will it not ſuffice (ſays he) to wash away the <hi>foulneſs</hi> of ſin: Our <hi>Holy Penitent</hi> knew well that Death concludes all our merit, and demerit; that though the Juſt after this life shall perform many glorious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet theſe will not purchaſe to them any new Crowns, no more than the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate shall not become more criminal by

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54442:33"/> unhappy ſin of carnality: In the firſt place it drawes a Cloud over the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and ſo depreſſes the faculties of the Soul, as she becomes in a manner <hi>terreſtrial,</hi> that is, unable to elevate her ſelf beyond the objects of ſenſe; for the operations of the Soul are more perfect, as they are more abſtracted from materiality: Now this ſin wholly drowns, and takes us up in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of ſenſible things, and conſequently muſt needs debilitate, and weaken the Mind in her natural functions. In <hi>other paſsions,</hi> as Anger, Fear, Joy, and the like there are ſtill extant ſome <hi>Seeds of reaſon;</hi> this deſtroyes all that is Man in us, and makes Man by a thouſand homages, and venerations ſubject to that Sex, which God and Nature have deſigned Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour; as if it aimed not only at Mans deſtruction, but to reſolve the <hi>World</hi> into another Chaos: For what shafts of Gods vengeance have fallen heavy upon Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that were not directed to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of this ſin: It was an inordinate appetite to mix with the Daughters of <hi>Gentiles</hi> that firſt gave birth to Monſters, and Gyants; and from their accurſed off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring the <hi>Earth</hi> became ſuch a ſink of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54442:35"/> main Hinge of humane Society to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve which Nature chiefly tends in all her principles, and eſſential motions. Laſtly, a breach is made in <hi>humane</hi> Law by Adultery, in that Marriage is not a private but domeſtick good, which concerns not one, but infinite Families, ſtrengthened by the Laws of the Church, and publick Faith of Nations: From hence <hi>Nature</hi> finds thoſe who carefully cultivate her plants; hence Commonwealths are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Citizens, the Church with Children. By this we may ſee the malice of Adultery, that drawes along with it the violation of ſo many Laws. Chriſt enjoyns us <hi>a love of our Enemies;</hi> and that <hi>the Sun ſhould not ſet in our anger.</hi> Yet in the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of Marriage-Bed permits a ſeparation between Man and Wife, how ſtrictly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever united by indiſſoluble tyes, as if ſuch crimes ſurpaſſed the limits of pardon; as if an evil ſo deſtructive, that remedies could find no place, and that this indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual life once diſſolved, could no more be recalled than habit from privation.</p>
               <p>Many Tyrants have ſubdued to therage of their cruelties the wealth, liberty, and lives of their Subjects, who looking upon
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54442:36"/> this power as given from Heaven over them, patiently ſuſtained all thoſe depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; but if once they touched upon their <hi>wives,</hi> and would involve them in the Maſs of their impurities, this rowſed up their <hi>fallen ſpirits,</hi> caſt them into <hi>rebellion,</hi> nay pushed them to that <hi>extremity</hi> as never to deſiſt untill they had deprived thoſe of life, who had <hi>raviſhed</hi> from them what was more dear than <hi>life;</hi> untill they had redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto ashes the Authors of their infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and taught them for the example of poſterity this violence of all others will not be left unrevenged in this World.</p>
               <p>There hath ſcarce been any Nation though <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> which hath not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Adultery</hi> with Death or exquiſite Torments: <hi>Some</hi> by fire, <hi>others</hi> by wild Horſes; <hi>ſome</hi> by the Halter, <hi>others</hi> in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out their Eyes, cutting off their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; <hi>ſome</hi> by ſtones as in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law: Whence 'tis clear that even the light of Nature taught, there ought for the good of humane Society that a ſtop be made to this diſorder.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Penitent</hi> having in his thoughts lay'd open all thoſe Enormities of an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Act, is ſurpriſed to ſee himſelf plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

                  <hi>Becauſe I know my iniquity:</hi> This knowledge evidences the return of Grace to his Soul. In the 35. <hi>Pſalm</hi> he deſcribes his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the ſtate of ſin: <hi>My iniquities
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54442:39"/> ſurrounded me, and I could ſee nothing:</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> exclaims againſt that day, wherein he committed ſin, and queſtions whether he may call it day; ſince he was involved in a profound obſcurity, and then he goes on, ſaying, he will riſe, and diſperſe the <hi>miſts</hi> of his iniquities, that he may ſee the <hi>fountain</hi> of all goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Petitioner</hi> again in the 48. <hi>Pſalm</hi> gives <hi>Man</hi> (when enſlaved by ſin) the title of <hi>Beaſt,</hi> nay with ſomething of aggravation, aſſimilating him to a <hi>Fooliſh Beaſt:</hi> He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred how <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, was cloathed with <hi>Skins of Beaſts;</hi> which attire was but a Symbol of his Mind beſtiatized, and made Savage by tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe Clouds of darkneſs, wherein poor ſinners lye grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; ſayes, it proceeds from a propenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bent upon evil, averſed from God and deprived of grace: The oppoſite beams then, which fill our Souls with light and ſerenity, muſt needs draw their ſource from a love of what is good, an adhaeſion to God, and a ſweet repoſſeſſion of grace, and in theſe ſplendours our <hi>Petitioner</hi> finds himſelf: Firſt, they raiſe his <hi>Soul</hi> to an Object infinitely good, and amiable,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54442:39"/> and after vehement affections enkindled towards this Sovereign felicity, his <hi>Eyes</hi> are unſealed, and beholds the Ghaſtly shape of his ſins, which caſt him into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations againſt his own unworthineſs, upon reiterated addreſſes for mercy and pardon, and at laſt admitted into favour; he learns by that ineſtimable gift (under whoſe Dominion he now lives) what it is to offend God, how monſtrous a thing ſin is, and therefore will not conceal his new acquired notions, but proclaim. <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam &amp;c. becauſe I know my iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was not an <hi>abſtract knowledge</hi> of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity he alledges, for this may conſiſt with the moſt innocent and ſpotleſs Soul, and was found in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall: But 'tis what he had learnt by dear experience; he had taſted that Tree which imports <hi>knowledge of good and evil,</hi> but alas, far different from thoſe pure <hi>Idaeas,</hi> which reſide in Souls that were never involved in the shades of ſin; for ſuch ſurvey with an intellect as it were Angelical, the commands of God and in obedience to his Law make uſe of their knowledge, but to avoid the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication: But our <hi>Petitioner</hi> looks upon the deformity of ſin in all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54442:40"/> of the Abyſs of ruine it drawes upon us, and having with the <hi>Cananean</hi> cryed for mercy, then he confeſſes his nakedneſs, then he layes open his failings, and blush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es not at the knowledge of his iniquity, becauſe they are now washed in a Chriſtal ſtream, and their paſt horrours ſerve but to raiſe in him a deteſtation of them, and to invite him at the ſame time to admire the Wiſdom of God, that thus by his peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial acts will manifeſt his <hi>Juſtice;</hi> and laſtly to praiſe his mercy that hath given him a <hi>perfect knowledge</hi> of his iniquity, as a certain Land-mark to preſerve him from future Shipwrack; <hi>becauſe I know my iniquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I remember the <hi>Prodigal Son,</hi> when lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing in miſery, and perishing for hunger, pitched only upon this remedy, that he would tell his Father he had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>againſt Heaven and him:</hi> In like manner our <hi>Petitioner</hi> layes aſide the thought of any good he may have done, offers to the view of his eternal Father all the wounds of his cauterized Soul, and that he might engage himſelf to a compleat diſcovery, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he is not ignorant, but knowes all the Windings, and extravagant progreſſions of his iniquity; how they had led him
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54442:40"/> from <hi>Adultery</hi> to <hi>Homicide,</hi> thence to <hi>Pride, Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Sole reliance</hi> on his own greatneſs and power, and when he had ſummed up all his ingratitudes, he gives this account, <hi>Domine opus tuum vivica illud, Lord I know my Sin.</hi> So likewiſe I know the temper of the delinquent, how he is compoſed of frailties, unable of himſelf to ſet his hand to any good vvork, to any ſupernatural motion: Wherefore he hopes this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration may ſomething take off, and render his deviations leſs irregular.</p>
               <p>Yet on the other ſide he will not flatter himſelf into a blameleſs condition, he knows a ſupport of Grace ever attended him amidſt his predominant paſſions, and ſmarteſt tryals, by whoſe means he might have been victorious: This brings him on his Knees, and drawes from him an humble confeſſion. <hi>Becauſe I know my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was this knowledge fixing him on the <hi>baſis</hi> of humility which prepared him for thoſe ſublime, and ſupernatural commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications he afterwards received from his dear Creatour: What are his <hi>Pſalms</hi> but a <hi>Series of raptures,</hi> and coeleſtial ravishments, a Tabernacle of ſacred myſteries vvith
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54442:41"/> vvhich his underſtanding was fed; that vve may ſee to vvhat pitch Man is capable of ariſing from this knowledge of our Sins. How confidently did St. <hi>Peter</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in his denial of Chriſt, and cryed as naturally, <hi>I know not the Man;</hi> as if he had been nurſed up in infidelity: It was only the reflection upon his perfidious Crime, and a clear view of it, that brought him to himſelf, and ſprung in him ſuch flouds of tears. What caſt St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch rigours vvhich ſeem incomparable vvith humane Nature but a ſenſe, and knowledge of her tranſgreſſions. What opened Heavens-Gate to the expiring Thief but this: <hi>Nos quidem digna factis reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pimus; We truly receive a puniſhment which our crimes deſerve.</hi> In a word, you shall find no remarkable change in the life of any perſon from Vice to Vertue, which took not its firſt rice from a ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their former ingratitude; and this is confirmed in the example of our Holy <hi>Petitioner;</hi> vvho firſt cryes out <hi>he hath ſinned,</hi> and preſently hears <hi>Nathan,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims a pardon, after which aſſurance, he ſits not ſtill, nor returns to his Vomit, but will for the future offer up as many

               <p>What dreads and horrors beſieged the Heart of <hi>Cain,</hi> every shadow he beheld ſeemed to threaten Death and deſtruction to him, ſo that his thoughts were alwayes lodged in a Sepulchre; the <hi>memory</hi> of his crimes ſtill riſing up as <hi>witneſs</hi> againſt him, with how juſt reaſon then did St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> cry: <hi>Lord thou haſt commanded, and it is fulfilled, that a vicious Soul proves to her ſelf her own tormentour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſayes, God hath given to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul a certain Harmony, which infinitely delights, and recreates that ſpiritual ſubſtance, now when by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate actions she diſſolves this unity, there muſt needs ſpring from this diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great grief or anguish, though the cauſe

If then this <hi>great Philoſopher</hi> gives affliction as a <hi>natural effect</hi> of ſin, what muſt he endure who hath the addition of a <hi>ſupernatural precept,</hi> when he looks upon it infringed, and made the Subject of his contempt; when he weighs the <hi>loſs</hi> he hath made of Grace, the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of miſery, wherein he is plunged; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this muſt create within us a <hi>torment</hi> far beyond any impreſſion of cruelty, or malice from abroad.</p>
               <p>This is the ſtate of our Penitent; let him go where he will, he finds a <hi>Tribunal</hi> erected within him, where his Caſe is ſcanned to the full, and all his Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces laid home to him; whil'ſt he in the mean like poor <hi>Job</hi> not able to return one word for a thouſand, looks about, at leſt to fee ſome Councel, but alas, every one withdraws, nay his own Conſcience riſes up againſt him.</p>

               </p>
               <p>We need ſeek no other Topicks to prove the terrour which remorſe brings to a Conſcience, then our Penitent's own words in the 54. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>Diſcedunt in Infernum viventes, they deſcend alive into Hell.</hi> He thought no alluſion, but to the ſtate of the damned could reach this misfortune, ſo that whoſoever is upon the rack of a tortured Conſcience ſeems to anticipate his ſad doom, and to find a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54442:44"/> Hell even upon Earth, and no wonder when <hi>Mercurius Triſmegiſtus</hi> aſſerts, that the Body by habitual ſin becomes brutish, and the Mind turns to be a Devil, which chaſtiſes and afflicts the offendour with the ſtripes of his own ſin.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>ſad Penitent</hi> little foreſaw this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my within him at the beginning, his whole Solicitude was only to dazle the Eyes of the World, by that means to ſtifle the dishonour might ariſe from his crimes. He ſends for <hi>

Behold all his policy blown up in an inſtant, and beſides he hath this ſlow Executioner of his own Conſcience, which like a shadow inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably attends him, and makes him groan forth: <hi>My ſin is alwayes before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicure</hi> was of Opinion, exorbitant acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54442:45"/> ought to be declined upon the ſole motive of fear which alwayes invades the Minds of Criminals; this shews that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is diſordered by Evil (for this <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> had no other ray than that of reaſon) and the diſturbance we find to ſpring from tranſgreſſions, is but an effect of nature in order to its own preſervation: For who would conceive (did not ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience render it manifeſt) that Man could ſupport the conſtant reproaches and sharp ſentences of his condemning Conſcience, for the enjoyment of ſome ſlight pleaſure of Carnality, Revenge, and the like: Which as a flash of lightning inſtead of glory and delight, leaves us to moulder away in the ashes of dishonour, and to be ſurrounded with torments, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had at a full pauſe taſted the cauſe and ſubject of our chaſtiſements.</p>
               <p>Hence methinks <hi>Plato</hi> happily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a perſon enſlaved to his ſenſualities unto one who hatches, and nurſes up a <hi>Chymaera</hi> conſiſting of many exact linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and after a thouſand complacent thoughts of this phantaſtick beauty, it is found at laſt to be a meer effect of the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54442:46"/> to repentance, not to obdurateneſs, nor deſpair, and his hope is, that after they have agitated and raiſed the ſtorms of ſad remembrances within him, a gracious calm of pardon will follow, as well to ſettle peace and ſecurity in his Soul, as to banish for ever from his ſight the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous ſpectacle of his ſins; which is now the ſad ſubject of his complaint, and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter remorſe; <hi>my ſin is alwayes before me.</hi>

All this put together ſeems to reflect on the ſincerity of our Penitent's proceedings, and that he would diſguiſe, if not wholly ſuppreſs a main part of his offences, yet let us examine e're we cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and I believe his confeſſion will not be found to want the due circumſtances of a true repentance. <hi>I have ſinned</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>againſt God alone.</hi> He conſiders <hi>firſt</hi> he is a criminal, <hi>next</hi> he beholds no power on Earth, which hath right to take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of his treſpaſs, and to carry on a compleat proceſs againſt him; the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had taught him, the anointed of God are ſacred things not to be violated by any hand, wherefore ſince no <hi>humane Law</hi> could reach him, for that power is not ſupream which is linked to any dependency: To whom can he acknowledge himſelf an <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour,</hi> but to him who is <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and from whom all <hi>Dominion</hi> both in Heaven and Earth is derived? He alone is his <hi>Judge,</hi> he alone can punish or ſave, and to his ſole will he ſubmits himſelf, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his miſdeeds.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54442:48"/>
               <p>This ſpecification of his Royal dignity which exempts him from all Earthly <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> renders him not more <hi>innocent,</hi> but rather is a circumſtance of aggravation; for the perfection of the perſon offending, is a note of higher ingratitude proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the excellency of his nature; and therefore Divines conclude the ſin of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> to be the moſt Enormous that ever was committed: <hi>Firſt</hi> becauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his nature; <hi>next</hi> in that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſtrook at the ſource of his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for which he ought to have been more grateful than other Creatures, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taſted more liberally than any other of his divine Favours. <hi>Laſtly</hi> from the cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or conſequence of his ſin, which gave a riſe, and was the foundation of all the evil that hath happened in the World, and in Heaven before it was created, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming both Angels, and Men by his temptations; as in <hi>Tobit</hi> Chap. 4. <hi>From the Pride of the Devil all ruine and perdition is derived, and took its beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we look upon the <hi>dignity</hi> of our Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, we shall find none above him upon Earth; if on the <hi>favours</hi> showred upon him from Heaven, he appears the Object of

Hence I wonder not if St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, <hi>it is hard for Princes to commit a ſmall offence:</hi> For the eminency of their place obliges them to ſo much integrity, that the leaſt blemish in them grows up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a monſtrous deformity; they are as it were the <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> upon which all the other Orbs depend in their motion; Nay <hi>Caſsidorus</hi> ſayes <hi>it were more credible that Nature could erre, than for a Prince to frame a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth different from the conſtitution of his own life:</hi> For he is not onely a glaſs wherein the people contemplate the Idea or platform of what they ought to do, but a glaſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming, and iſſuing forth incentives to imitation: Have we not ſeen a <hi>Rome</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick under <hi>Romulus,</hi> religious under <hi>Numa,</hi> continent under <hi>Fabritius,</hi> diſſolute under <hi>Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Anthony,</hi> Idolatrous under <hi>Julian,</hi> and drenched in <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> under <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> to shew the people are alwayes mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the temper of their Prince; nay think it a crime not to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and believe every leading action in him, may authorize and make good any
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54442:49"/> wickedneſs in them. It was for this cauſe the <hi>Poets</hi> feigned their gods to have been vicious, that from thence they might claim a title, and right to do the like; and <hi>Terentius</hi> excuſes a young man taken in adultery, becauſe he had ſeen the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of <hi>Jupiter</hi> repreſenting ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of obſcenity.</p>
               <p>The prophet <hi>Hoſeah</hi> in his Fifth Chapter threatens judgement and ruin to Kings, who have become a <hi>Snare</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> to their ſubjects; and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſtiles bad Kings the worſt of homicides, in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Souls of their Subjects.</p>
               <p>Our ſad Penitent was not a ſtranger to his own condition, he knew well his duty to God, and how many obligations of vertue were annexed to a Crown; he therefore now alledges his <hi>regal power,</hi> not to diminish, but rather to give a full view of his tranſgreſſion; by this he confeſſes, that he hath broke his Faith with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Men, deceiving the publick o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they had of his vertue, upon which preſumption, their Lives, Fortunes, and what moſt dear to them, were shrowded under his guidance, and protection: By this he declares the Throne is to <hi>edify,</hi> not

                  <hi>deſtroy</hi> the lookers on; for a King mediates 'twixt God and Man: Now that a <hi>Vacuum</hi> might not happen, but a happy concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation preſerved, it is as neceſſary <hi>a King ſhould adhere to God, as he would have the People conſtantly faithful to him;</hi> a Chriſtian Prince ought to make <hi>God,</hi> not <hi>Policy</hi> the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Object of his ſway; ſo that he muſt firſt conſecrate himſelf, next his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the ſervice of his Creatour: And if he do it not, he ſeems to overwhelm and confound both divine, and humane Laws. By this he ackowledges his own miſery, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, Kings are not to be eſteemed happy from their conqueſts and ſucceſs of Arms, but by uſing their power in the advancement of God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſervice; if they love, fear, and reverence him, if they make their own greatneſs ſtoop and lye proſtrate before his Divine Majeſty; <hi>laſtly,</hi> if they more value the ſweet reign of vertue within them, than all the dazling glories of their Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

He remembred in <hi>Leviticus</hi> it was decreed, the ſame proportion of Sacrifices for the Prieſt, as for the Univerſal people; and what ſatisfactions might then juſtly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him, into whoſe hands are entru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the guidance of that choſen Nation; and to fail in ſo important an affair, muſt needs involve a greater blame.

                  <p>In this clauſe, we read the clear view our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> had of the unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable proceedings of God with Man; for beholding in his all-diſplaying Eye the <hi>ingratitude</hi> of Millions of Souls who would abuſe his <hi>favours,</hi> yet did not this reſtrain his <hi>munificence</hi> to them; he firſt gave them a <hi>Being,</hi> added to this Being the <hi>exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition</hi> of his Graces, all ſufficient, nay in a greater proportion than to many of the elect; and to the acquiſition of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits he made his only <hi>Son inſtrumental,</hi> by whoſe <hi>blood</hi> is conveyed to them a <hi>capacity of Salvation:</hi> Now if afterwards they come to perish, it is through their own malice in miſuſing his <hi>gracious endearments,</hi> and proving refractary to his commands, for ſince he had conducted them indiſcriminately with the predeſtinate by a ſupernatural Providence, with which all along he obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, what wiſdome, prudence, or juſtice were it to gratify Traytors (obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate even unto death in rebellion) with his Glory: So that the motive of their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi> is a foreſight of their final <hi>perſeverance
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54442:56"/> in Sin;</hi> their <hi>guiltineſs</hi> gives matter of God's <hi>hatred,</hi> and <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> the effect of their <hi>impenitency.</hi> 'Tis true it was not in their power to be born, or not be born; but to fight generouſly, or be vanquished by the Devil this depends on us: It ſeems un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that a King opening a <hi>Tourna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and propoſing a <hi>reward</hi> to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, should admit onely that perſon into the <hi>list</hi> whom he fereſaw would be <hi>victorious:</hi> So God in Creating an infinity of perſons whereof the greater part would become reprobate is not to be blamed, no more than that <hi>Prince</hi> who lets all run at the ring though it cannot be gained but by <hi>one,</hi> for if we be foyld it is by our own Cowardize and remiſſneſs. Thus the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God appears in the Creation of Reprobates, and no leſs his <hi>juſtice</hi> in pouring vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſo that he would be juſtified in his words, and ſilence any blaſphemous Tongue; nay, though theſe unfortunate wretches miſs of their particular end that is <hi>paradiſe</hi> to which they are created, yet the general deſign of their Creation, to wit the promotion of his Glory, will take effect: for after his <hi>patience</hi> hath been ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (if it may be ſo expreſſed) in ſupporting
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54442:56"/> their inſolencies, he will give luſtre to his <hi>Saints Glory</hi> by the oppoſition of their <hi>miſery;</hi> juſt as a <hi>Moor</hi> ſets off a <hi>great beauty.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us keep conſort with our Holy <hi>Penitent,</hi> avowing his juſt <hi>providence,</hi> and ſubmitting to all his <hi>Decrees,</hi> as moſt equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and worthy our Adorations,</p>

This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, together with the dreggs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of corruption which <hi>original ſin</hi> leaves behind, I wonder not if our <hi>Penitent</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his misfortune, and hints in his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition this <hi>memorandum; that he was conceived in iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Fomes</hi> or ſcattered ſeed of <hi>original ſin</hi> hath a double effect, <hi>one</hi> an inclination to evil, the <hi>other</hi> a drawing back, or declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what is good: This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſs, <hi>he found a Law in his Body contradicting that of his reaſon;</hi> and St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſayes, <hi>the ſin</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:54442:57"/> ('tis true) <hi>may be taken away by Baptiſm, but to work a compleat cure, that we feel no ſpice, nor itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the infection, is in a manner impoſsible; at leaſt it requires a long courſe of remedies by a conſtant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Tryal in vertuous actions: For it is an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and habitual concupiſcence in the ſenſitive part, ſo radicated, that it becomes (as it were) a portion of nature:</hi> Whence <hi>Seneca</hi> affirms, <hi>vertues are rarely acquired without a Maſter, but we quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come expert in vice without the help of any Teacher,</hi> which shews the pernicious conſequence of <hi>original ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Penitent</hi> had found the bitterneſs of it by dear experience, and this push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on to the reflection of a main cauſe of his miſery; becauſe <hi>he was conceived in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet our <hi>Penitent</hi> repines not at God's <hi>Juſtice</hi> herein, but ſubmits to this <hi>ſmart doom,</hi> acknowledging a <hi>juſt retaliation;</hi> that ſince the Soul had been diſobedient to her Creatour, the Body in requital should riſe up in rebellion againſt her, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish her by the ſame Engins she had made uſe off in her prevarication; he doth not ſcan the <hi>motives</hi> why God should punish ſo ſeverely <hi>many millions</hi> of innocent Souls, for the miſcarriage of <hi>one</hi> Man, and though
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54442:58"/> he could ſatisfy himſelf, that ſince <hi>original Juſtice</hi> had been purchaſed to all <hi>Adam's</hi> deſcendents by his obedience, it is not unreaſonable to share by his fall in the pain due to his tranſgreſſion: Our <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi> I ſay waves all argumentation, looks upon the ſentence pronounced, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and being a <hi>Decree</hi> from God, it muſt be <hi>juſt:</hi> His ſole hope is, that this diſordered, and depraved conſtitution in humane nature, will draw a more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful aid, and greater compaſſion towards a ſinner when he fails, and ſtill the <hi>burden of his Song is, becauſe he was conceived in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſeems unreſolved, and full of perplexity, when he conſiders Man in this tottering condition, it makes him confeſs, he knowes not by what ſtrange bewitching means our will impared by ſin is hampered in a kind of neceſſity, and in ſuch a manner, as neither the <hi>neceſsity</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe voluntary, can plead excuſe for our <hi>conſent;</hi> nor the <hi>will</hi> being allured, can ſcarce break through the <hi>neceſsity;</hi> for this <hi>neceſsity</hi> is in ſome ſort <hi>voluntary,</hi> it is a kind of <hi>amorous violence</hi> working by <hi>flattery,</hi> and <hi>flattering</hi> by <hi>force:</hi> Whence the Will having
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54442:58"/> once conſented to ſin, can hardly diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her ſelf, nor yet finds reaſon enough to excuſe what she hath done.</p>
               <p>Upon this ſcore I wonder not to hear the plaining note of <hi>Job. Lord I ſuffer violence, it is onely you who impoſe the neceſsity can anſwer for me.</hi> And a little after he cryes, <hi>O thou Ruler of men, why haſt thou ſet me againſt thee;</hi> all which shews the ſad State of man wrought by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal ſin, if left to himſelf: <hi>for he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in iniquities.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Philo</hi> the Jew ſpeaking of <hi>Sin</hi> gives it a Term of <hi>infinity,</hi> that being once ſet a flame can never be <hi>extinguiſhed:</hi> he calls it an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal evil,</hi> by no death, or deſolation to be deſtroyed. The truth of this Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy who finds not in himſelf, that albeit Baptiſm hath cleared the channel, ſo as the ſtreams of grace may run, yet there are certain exhalations which iſſued from that corruption always ready to fall, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body with the currant; ſo that if there be not a continual care and ſifting, it will be morally impoſſible to preſerve our Souls pure, and unſtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayes, <hi>there are certain vices which are obvious to every Eye, and to which we may be led as it were by the hand; others there are that lye lurking,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54442:59"/> and are hardly diſcerned, till faſtned upon us; and theſe are the moſt pernicious, becauſe againſt them we can have nither open warr, nor a ſecure peace:</hi> And this truly is the genuine <hi>State</hi> of our natures from the corruption wrought in us by ſin, that we are not ſaid to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſick, or well; and this <hi>fluctuancy</hi> (if right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered) muſt needs be a <hi>torment,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe though we happen not to fall, yet danger ſtill threatens, ſo that if we tender our <hi>happineſs,</hi> we muſt ſtand upon our <hi>guard</hi> at all times, and places, becauſe neither <hi>Heaven, Paradiſe, Religious Cloyſter,</hi> or <hi>remote Hermitage</hi> is a ſecure fence againſt ſin; and a main reaſon to us the Children of <hi>Adam</hi> is, becauſe <hi>in iniquitatibus conceptus ſum, we are conceived and born in iniquities.</hi>

               <p>Whilſt we are invironed and beſet with ſuch <hi>adverſaries</hi> as our <hi>bad inclinations,</hi> who watch (as I may ſay) but an advantage to undo us, ſurely we ought to work out our Salvation with fear and trembling; St. <hi>Bernard</hi> was not ignorant of Mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy when he gave this caution; <hi>Oh</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>did we but know, how ſmall a portion of vertue we have, and how ſoon it vaniſhes, upon how tickliſh a foundation it reſts, unleſs the giver by a continued flux of Grace ſecure it to us, we would
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54442:59"/> not ſo eaſily imbark our ſelves into dangerous occaſions, for to indulge our ſenſes, and to arm our Enemies, is the ſame, but a ſtrange policy.</hi> How many who have thought themſelves like <hi>Cedars</hi> ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to a high pitch of vertue, by a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their own ſtrength through ignorance of humane frailty, and a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine negligence, rashly engaging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in hazardous Tryals, have been ignominiouſly blaſted, and reduced to the condition of a <hi>contemptible ſhrub.</hi>

                  <hi>Lucifer</hi> enamoured of his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and aſpiring to a parity with God, became the moſt <hi>abject</hi> of Creatures.

               <p>Our <hi>Penitent</hi> comes in alſo for a ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and hopes it will ſerve at leaſt for a monument to Poſterity, that they may reflect what Man is from the inſtant of his conception, and however he may be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enobled by God's favours, yet in his 103. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> he tells what he muſt truſt to when left to himſelf. <hi>Auferes ſpiritum eorum &amp; deficient, &amp; in pulverem ſuum revertentur;</hi> upon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54442:60"/> the ſubtraction of thy Spirit, O Lord we ſink; and reſolve into the duſt from whence we came, all covered, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with the ſtains of ſin.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, becauſe Man did not what he could and might have done, now he hath a deſire to that he cannot perform; loſing by a will of malice the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> become as it were a captive cryes, <hi>the evil I would not now I do,</hi> truly it is an expreſſion which might terrify, were it not that a little he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, there is a power of grace which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts this predominancy of <hi>nature,</hi> and therefore in the Sixth Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> he warns us <hi>not to let ſin reign in our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodies;</hi> intimating hereby, the ſeeds of tumults and ſeditions be ſowed within us, yet we have alſo <hi>arms,</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient (if we adhere to God) to crush, and fruſtrate all their inſolencies: So true it is that Man cannot be injured but by himſelf, to whom alone he owns his ruine if he perish.</p>
               <p>Thus the life of Man is become a <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare</hi> upon Earth, the <hi>Seat</hi> of many a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and ſtrife; the <hi>ſenſitive part</hi> haling him one way, <hi>reaſon</hi> another, and this by a juſt
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54442:60"/> Decree of Heaven, that ſince he would not have <hi>peace</hi> with God, he should have <hi>warr</hi> brought to his own doors, and feel it within himſelf. Now to come off clear, and ſafe amidſt ſo many hurley burleys, requires no ſmall dexterity and courage: It minds me of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> anſwer to his friend who importuned him not to remove his Camp, though neceſſity urged it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ſick, and could not without much pain endure any motion; whereat <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> all perplexed what to do crys, <hi>O how hard a thing is it to be wiſe, and yet compaſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi> So our <hi>ſenſitive part</hi> made treacherous by ſin, ſtill makes its moan, fawns, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits with importunity; and if the <hi>Will</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little condeſcend, Man is preſently loſt in ſenſual pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Penitent</hi> had felt the ſmart of this Shipwrack, how ſoon he was overthrown by a little dalliance; and therefore expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the view of his Judge the ſource from whence he ſprings, and hopes ſince he knowes his brittle ſubſtance, it may plead ſome inducement unto mercy, at leaſt to a mitigation of his penalty; upon this ſcore he proclaims, <hi>behold I am conceived in iniquities.</hi>

               <p>Now for the reaſon why he puts us upon this task of <hi>good Husbandry</hi> to repair our loſſes; <hi>becauſe the dayes are evil:</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, there are <hi>two things</hi> (ſayes he) which give <hi>birth</hi> to theſe our <hi>unfortunate dayes; One,</hi> the common miſery of Mankind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin: For caſt your thoughts on the Maſs of things created, and you will find none ſo indigent, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfyed, and reduced to ſuch ſtraights as <hi>Man;</hi> other <hi>Creatures</hi> are no ſooner brought into the World, but nature gives them a capacity of helping themſelves; <hi>Man</hi> after he is born for many years hath his underſtanding ſo tyed up, that he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a meer <hi>Brute</hi> only ſurpaſſed by them in an <hi>induſtry</hi> to preſerve <hi>natural life;</hi> other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures find here thoſe objects which quiet all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54442:63"/> their motions; the <hi>elementary Bodies</hi> meet with their Centers which ſettle them in a full repoſe; the <hi>natural appetite</hi> of Beaſts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters that which ſatiates and gluts all their avidities; <hi>plants</hi> grow to a certain greatneſs proper to their ſpecies: <hi>Man</hi> only is the <hi>unſatisfyed Being</hi> upon Earth, for his <hi>underſtanding</hi> elevates his thoughts above the Heavens, and all the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; his <hi>will</hi> frames infinitely more <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi> than the <hi>World</hi> hath <hi>perfections;</hi> ſo that there being found no Object upon Earth adequately proportioned to the vaſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of his Soul, it is neceſſary he ſtill languish here in a State of diſſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>This caſts him upon ſo many shelves of miſery, and makes him reſtleſs, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill to find ſomething to allay his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: Sometimes he fancies <hi>riches</hi> would do it, but finding them ordained to the purchaſe of other things, it cannot be a ſovereign good; thence he flyes to <hi>honour,</hi> and obſerving that alſo to depend upon the breath and will of another; he faſtens on <hi>beauty,</hi> this likewiſe he perceives to fade, and perish by a thouſand accidents; this invites him to the acquiſition of <hi>knowledge,</hi> and after many a toilſome hour he finds
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54442:64"/> only this proficiency, how little we are capable of, that the <hi>leaſt plant</hi> of the Earth will puzzle and confront all his <hi>acquired Notions</hi> to render the true vertues of it: Thus he paſſes on from the Eſſay of one delight to another, ſtill as unwearied, as unſatisfyed; and why all this? But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>my Mother hath conceived me in ſin:</hi> For my Mother conceiving me in ſin, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inheritance the doom of Death, and of miſeries conſequent to a mortal Life, and ſo cannot but convey the like direful effects to her poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Timon</hi> an Orator of <hi>Athens</hi> was wont to deliver ſo pathetically the miſeries of Man in this Life, that after his Oration which he held forth in publick, it was uſual for <hi>many</hi> of his Audience to haſten their paſſage unto <hi>Death</hi> by a courſe of violence, ſome by <hi>precipices,</hi> others by <hi>water,</hi> ſome by <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> others by a <hi>ponyard,</hi> or <hi>halter: In fine,</hi> they regarded not much the <hi>means,</hi> ſo it might but have the <hi>effect;</hi> that is, to rid them from the Calamities to be ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life. In a word, his <hi>Eloquence</hi> wrought ſo many <hi>Tragedies,</hi> that the <hi>Senate</hi> was feign to make a recluſe of him, that by ſequeſtring him from <hi>humane Society</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:54442:64"/> they might prevent the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>This perſon was an Infidel who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only Man's <hi>corporal neceſsities,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his <hi>failings</hi> in order to <hi>moral vertues,</hi> and if from this Ground he could draw ſuch efficacious perſwaſions, what would he have done with the addition of our Penitent's Faith, which teaches that <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity,</hi> or <hi>miſery</hi> depend upon our <hi>actions</hi> here; that we lye under the Obligation of many poſitive precepts, againſt whoſe obſervance are laid continual Ambuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's, both from the malice of Hell, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the World, and our own bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; that in the midſt of theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent dangers we ſteer our Courſe to an Eternity of <hi>Joyes,</hi> or <hi>Pain:</hi> What E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy I ſay, would this conſideration add to the draught of our miſery, when we not only ſuffer here, but ſuffer with ſo much hazzard of incurring the doom of Torments without end.</p>
               <p>Ah blame not then our <hi>Penitent,</hi> if he ſet before his Eyes, and is willing alſo the petitioned should glance upon his condition in this ſtate of mortality; his own reflections will ſerve to keep him in
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54442:65"/> a wary humility checked with the frailties and inconſtancy of his own nature; the notice alſo his dear Creatour may take of what mould he is made, will ſtand (he hopes) in good ſtead, for he knowes him ſo inclinable to pardon, that (if it may be ſaid with reverence) he lyes at catch for an opportunity to ſave us, and if the leaſt hold be given, he preſently faſtens upon it, and haſtens away (like a <hi>Souldier</hi> laden with a rich booty, of which he fears the <hi>repriſal</hi>) till he brings us to a place of ſecurity, where we shall have no more reaſon to fear the irregular motions of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, no more to vent in ſadneſs; <hi>And my Mother hath conceived me in ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Holy <hi>Job</hi> that prodigy of humane Conſtancy amidſt the ſmarteſt Tryals was yet ſo ſenſible of Man's miſery in this life, as to fall with bitterneſs upon the <hi>very day</hi> wherein he was brought forth, wishing it might perish, and never be reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt dayes in the courſe of the <hi>Zodiack;</hi> Nay he goes ſo farr that he involves in his <hi>Anathema's</hi> every circumſtance which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to his Conception, or Nativity.

                  <hi>Hugo Cardinal</hi> preſcribes unto us <hi>verity</hi> under three conſiderations; that is, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>life,</hi> a verity of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and a verity of <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verity of <hi>life</hi> conſiſts in a <hi>conformity</hi> with thoſe Laws which God and Nature have ſet down for the Rule of our actions, this our bleſſed Saviour ſufficiently aſſerts, when he gives the lye to him who pretends to <hi>love</hi> God, and yet not <hi>obſerves</hi> his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayes, there is a <hi>law eternal</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in the Divine intellect, by which the World is governed, and that <hi>humane lawes</hi> are more or leſs juſt, as they partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of this <hi>eternal rule:</hi> Hence our life if not ſquared out by this directive original, muſt needs wander, fall into errour, nor can be called a life of <hi>verity;</hi> nay I know not whether we may call it a life, ſince <hi>Lactantius</hi> affirms, that whoſoever ſtrayes out of this line, flyes from himſelf, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſes humane nature, and conſequently will ſuffer the torture of an erroneous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (which is not ſmall) though other punishments eſcape him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Principle then of a life of <hi>Truth,</hi> is to ſteer our Courſe in order to this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54442:68"/> univerſal guiding ſpirit imprinted in us by the light of nature; <hi>next,</hi> we are to look upon poſitive Lawes, dictated by the Holy Ghoſt, and the adorable example of our Lord Jeſus whoſe life and actions were all directed to our inſtruction: So that any <hi>ſtructure</hi> erected upon this <hi>foundation,</hi> cannot prove <hi>Sandy,</hi> nor fail the builders expectation.</p>
               <p>We find in holy Scripture frequently <hi>eternal felicity</hi> promiſed as a reward to good works; this the <hi>penny</hi> agreed on with thoſe who wrought in the Vineyard inſinuates, no leſs doth the <hi>Crown</hi> prepared for thoſe who faithfully combat in this life; the <hi>Triumph</hi> alſo of <hi>Reſurrection</hi> ſpeaks as much, aſſured to the <hi>real,</hi> not <hi>ideal</hi> ſupporters of Chriſt's Croſs: Nor is the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian given us as bare lookers on, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe actually made a ſpectacle to God; Angels, and Men. By acts therefore of <hi>Temperance, Patience, Humility, Reſignation,</hi> and other Chriſtian vertues, we shake off (as it were) our <hi>old Natures,</hi> and become a <hi>new production</hi> created in Juſtice and Truth, and ſo become the object of God's Love; becauſe <hi>Veritatem dilexiſti, he hath ever loved Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:54442:68"/>
               <p>If we look upon the unwearied la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of Men in purſuit of what may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them happy in this life, we shall find <hi>Truth</hi> to be the main ſcope of their aims.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is a priviledge of Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there being no <hi>Creature</hi> in the World but <hi>Man</hi> capable of <hi>truth;</hi> ſo that whilſt we toil in the inquiſition, we comply with an appetite, or deſire engrafted in us, which eggs us on towards the thing that can only make us happy: For <hi>Beatitude</hi> is defined <hi>a joy in the poſſeſsion of truth unveiled, and clearly diſcovered to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>delight</hi> we derive from the knowledge of Truths far ſurpaſſes any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> we can have in this World, becauſe depending meerly upon the <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect;</hi> it is depurated from the dreggs of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and ſo more intimately affects, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports the Soul: When by ſtudy we have attained to a <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> how quiet is the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> freed from all miſts of doubts, and uncertainty, and ſecurely reſts in the acquiſition of the ſaid truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if I covet a <hi>Friend,</hi> I propoſe in this deſign an <hi>object of truth,</hi> and fidelity; and if I find a breaſt ſealed with this ſacred ſtamp, how pleaſing a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> is it, where

               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Penitent</hi> having thus run o're the <hi>vaſt extent</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> and obſerved how it animates the actions of Men, takes occaſion from thence to adore God's <hi>holy Providence;</hi> that ſince he hath obliged us to a <hi>precept</hi> of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, and acknowledging our failings with all integrity, and fixed it as the <hi>ſole

               </p>
               <p>Ah what a change in this <hi>Holy King;</hi> not long before when <hi>Nathan</hi> laid before him his <hi>offence</hi> under the shadow of a <hi>poor Man</hi> violenced in the depredation of his <hi>only ſheep,</hi> he is dull, unfolds not the myſtery, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dreams (though it were plain enough) himſelf is pointed at, by which we may ſee what a <hi>miſt of ignorance,</hi> as well as other <hi>miſchiefs</hi> ſin draws along with it. But now he tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54442:72"/> the limits of <hi>natural knowledge,</hi> owns an irradiation of <hi>ſupernatural lights,</hi> and a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of <hi>diſcerning</hi> not only vvhat is <hi>paſt,</hi> or <hi>preſent,</hi> but vvhat is to <hi>come,</hi> and this in the ſecret, and uncertain things of God's <hi>VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true there is required in <hi>that perſon,</hi> who is made a <hi>repoſitory of Prophetick Truths,</hi> that he shine with <hi>integrity of life,</hi> have an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command over his <hi>paſsions,</hi> and poſſeſs a <hi>Mind</hi> elevated and fitted to <hi>contemplation.</hi> Yet God is not tyed up to previous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions by <hi>degrees,</hi> but can in a <hi>moment</hi> both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, and render perfect that party he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns for ſuch a dignity; as he hath done in the perſon of King <hi>David,</hi> and ſo, as to make him <hi>one</hi> of the moſt accomplished <hi>Prophets</hi> that ever was: For there is a great <hi>diſparity</hi> in prophetick irradiations, ſome are <hi>imperfect lights,</hi> and improperly called <hi>Prophetick,</hi> as what may proceed from an <hi>evil ſpirit,</hi> or from <hi>nature,</hi> as that of <hi>Pharoah</hi> when he ſaw oxen, and Ears of Corn, not knowing from whence that viſion might come, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was ſleeping, waking, and the like.</p>
               <p>Another degree <hi>more elevated</hi> is, when a <hi>ray</hi> is infuſed by which I certainly <hi>comprehend</hi> that which I ſee only by a <hi>ſpecies imaginary,</hi> ſuch
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54442:72"/> is <hi>Joſeph's</hi> caſe, who had an aſſured know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what he ſaw, that is, the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, whence he is more juſtly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Prophet</hi> than <hi>Pharoah,</hi> who only ſaw, and knew not what they ſignified.</p>
               <p>A Third degree <hi>more perfect</hi> is, when there are both an impreſſion of <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and <hi>ſenſible repreſentations,</hi> as alſo an <hi>infuſed light,</hi> by which I can judge of the <hi>verity</hi> of the thing diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before me; as <hi>Daniel</hi> could tell the King his Dream, and what it ſignified; for the <hi>Corporeal forms</hi> vvere fixed in his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the meaning of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>The laſt and <hi>nobleſt degree</hi> is, when a <hi>Truth</hi> is repreſented to us by <hi>ſpecies intelligible,</hi> and a <hi>light</hi> infuſed Superadded, which enables me infallibly to judge of what is repreſented by them, without any <hi>external medium</hi> of word, fact, or imaginary Viſion; and this laſt ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiation <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> aſcribes to <hi>David,</hi> whence he entitles him the moſt eminent amongſt all the <hi>Prophets.</hi>

               <p>But it will more <hi>recreate</hi> us to know what are thoſe <hi>uncertain,</hi> and <hi>hidden things</hi> laid open to him, than the <hi>manner how</hi> it vvas done: Some opinionate it vvas the <hi>Creation</hi> of the World, vvhere the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of God appears glorious in the admirable reduction of a

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54442:74"/> rigours of the ſeaſon, that a bloody deſign is hatched againſt him, to avoid which he muſt fly by Night into <hi>Egypt,</hi> through <hi>Cold</hi> and other <hi>dangers,</hi> attended only by his <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Mother,</hi> and her faithful Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour St. <hi>Joſeph,</hi> amidſt theſe diſcomfortable reflections; ſurely our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> failed not to remember the <hi>homages</hi> done to him, by the <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> that he might ſee he ſtill intermixed the <hi>Splendour</hi> of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with the <hi>Ecclipſes</hi> wrought, and caſt on his Humanity.</p>
               <p>From thence he carryes on his thoughts to Chriſt's Sacred <hi>Paſsion,</hi> where he lanches himſelf into an Ocean of <hi>miſery;</hi> not a <hi>drop</hi> trickles down of his <hi>bloody ſweat,</hi> but it makes him <hi>ſink;</hi> he diſtinctly ponders every <hi>blow</hi> lanced at him, every <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and every <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> He numbers his <hi>weary steps,</hi> whilſt he is haled from <hi>one</hi> Tribunal to <hi>another,</hi> he foreſees the <hi>ſhameful flight of his Apoſtles,</hi> and how he is abandoned in diſtreſſe by his neareſt, and deareſt Friends.</p>
               <p>Thus he ſifts every particular paſſage of that <hi>Sacred Tragedy,</hi> and were it not he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the conſideration of its <hi>immenſe Fruit,</hi> to wit, the <hi>redemption</hi> of the perished World, he would have shewed by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating Death, too much was revealed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54442:74"/> unto him, to be at once the <hi>Subject</hi> both of his <hi>knowledge,</hi> and <hi>life.</hi>

               <p>Now that this <hi>expreſsion</hi> of our <hi>Penitent</hi> doth quadrate with theſe <hi>myſteries;</hi> you muſt obſerve, that the <hi>ſecond perſon</hi> of the bleſſed Trinity is ſtyled the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe produced by an act of his <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and though his <hi>Incarnation</hi> were <hi>certain</hi> as <hi>decreed</hi> from all <hi>eternity,</hi> and <hi>foretold</hi> by many <hi>Prophets,</hi> yet it was <hi>uncertain</hi> as to the <hi>preciſe time,</hi> and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> as to the <hi>manner</hi> of his coming, and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occurrences</hi> of his <hi>life;</hi> it is true, both were couched in <hi>ſome prophecy</hi> or <hi>other,</hi> but ſo <hi>obſcurely</hi> that the moſt learned could not <hi>dive</hi> into them, until he came himſelf to <hi>unread</hi> them by his <hi>painful accompliſhment,</hi> and <hi>fulfilling</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Again by the <hi>uncertain things</hi> of his <hi>wiſdom</hi> imparted to him, he inſinuates a further <hi>knowledge</hi> as to <hi>this;</hi> that it is not <hi>known</hi> to any in <hi>this life,</hi> whether they are worthy of <hi>love</hi> or <hi>hatred:</hi> Almighty God (by a <hi>ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> no doubt) having kept this <hi>ſhut up</hi> from us, that whilſt we lye under an <hi>awefull fear,</hi> it might abate our <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>preſumption.</hi> Now the <hi>Clouds</hi> of this <hi>uncertainty</hi> were diſperſed as to him, <hi>aſſurance</hi> being given that his <hi>ſin</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the <hi>Anathema</hi> annexed to it tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en off, and what <hi>greater evidence</hi> that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted

               <p>Certainly if ever that ſaying was verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>where guilt hath raigned, there grace did yet more powerfully ſway,</hi> it was in the perſon of our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Petitioner his raptures, and Enthuſiaſtick throwes, his prophetick notions; Nay God's

               <p>Again this <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of Grace is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with the <hi>expectation</hi> of a Sovereign good: For the <hi>underſtanding</hi> enlightned by <hi>Faith,</hi> knowes that Mans's Beatitude is in God, that this <hi>Beatitude</hi> is promiſed him as his <hi>final end,</hi> and the <hi>means</hi> to attain unto this End is by <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>acts of vertue;</hi> So that he enjoyes it not but upon the <hi>terms</hi> of being one day eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>happy;</hi> this certain <hi>expectation</hi> of Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> calls the <hi>Anchor</hi> and <hi>baſis of Man in this life:</hi> It keeps him from <hi>dejection,</hi> placing ſtill before his thoughts an <hi>infinite good,</hi> and which is infallibly to be the <hi>abject</hi> of his <hi>future acquiſition;</hi> it choaks <hi>preſumption,</hi> caſting him upon the <hi>mediums</hi> ordained to lead him to this end; it draws his <hi>affections</hi> from terrene things, and raiſes them to God as the <hi>ſupream object</hi> alone worthy to be loved, and ſerved.</p>
               <p>What <hi>joy</hi> then to have our <hi>VVills</hi> carryed on by this <hi>gift of hope,</hi> which ſweetly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains us in the contemplation of <hi>Eternity,</hi> and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54442:87"/> this not as a thing doubtful (for what would Cloud the ſeverity of our comfort) but as a <hi>reward</hi> to which we are entitled by <hi>grace,</hi> and of which by this vertue of <hi>hope</hi> we have an <hi>earneſt</hi> and <hi>pledge.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes <hi>hope</hi> as a means to compaſs whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we would have. <hi>Let us approach with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Throne of Grace;</hi> as if we needed on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>firm hope,</hi> to be able to ſcale the <hi>Throne</hi> of God, and bear thence what ſo e're we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Gregory</hi> obſerves, there is no <hi>pleaſure</hi> in this World, which is not greater in the <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi> than <hi>fruition;</hi> by which we ſee what a ſtrange Operation the very <hi>hope</hi> of ſome <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral object</hi> hath in us; what <hi>raviſhments</hi> then muſt needs proceed from a <hi>hope</hi> that is fixed on the ſource of perfections; and to have this addition, that after our <hi>imaginations</hi> have propoſed all the <hi>delights</hi> that <hi>humane wit</hi> can frame, yet they fall infinitely short of thoſe <hi>joyes</hi> the Object of a <hi>ſupernatural hope</hi> will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto us.</p>
               <p>Blame not then our Petitioner if he give himſelf the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of joy and gladneſs, when once his Soul shall be enriched with <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>divine hope</hi> inſpired into him; ſince their <hi>preſence</hi> brings the higheſt <hi>ſatisfactions</hi> we are capable off in this World.</p>

               <p>When the <hi>Thief</hi> on the Croſs had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy, immediately follow the <hi>glad tidings</hi> he should exchange that very day his <hi>Gibbet</hi> into a <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> had no ſooner ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into the Paths of pennance, but he found himſelf overwhelmed with joy which he thus deſcribes. <hi>On a ſuddain</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>it grew delightful to me to be weaned from trifling pleaſures, and what before I feared to looſe, now with joy I diſmiſs; for thou, O ſupream Diety didſt tear them from me, and ſupplyedſt them by thy own preſence who art in all honour, beauty and pleaſure excelling.</hi> You ſee what he got in exchanging a few Worldly joyes for a life of pennance, in quitting a <hi>Creature</hi> he came to the enjoyment of his <hi>Creatour;</hi> in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoning that we muſt needs once loſe, and which we ſtill apprehend will be ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us, he arrived to an ineſtimable, and never perishing good.</p>
               <p>Nay <hi>reaſon</hi> may tell us, as happy <hi>experience</hi> hath informed Saints, that if his <hi>mercy</hi> be ſo <hi>great,</hi> and transforms it ſelf into ſo many Shapes of <hi>vertues</hi> in reward to <hi>ſinners;</hi> it muſt

               </p>
               <p>In the Fourth Book of <hi>Kings</hi> Chap. 13. We read that a <hi>Carkaſs</hi> being thrown into the Sepulchre of <hi>Elizeus,</hi> was by a <hi>touch</hi> of his <hi>Bones</hi> reſtored to <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> relates how <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great conveyed with much Solemnity the <hi>relicks</hi> of St <hi>Andrew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> unto <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Areadius</hi> likewiſe the Emperour tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>relicks of Samuel</hi> the Prophet from <hi>Judaea</hi> into <hi>Thraſia,</hi> where they were received with great <hi>veneration,</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> of the people: All which shews, our Forefathers looked upon the <hi>remainder</hi> of Saints Bodies, not as <hi>liveleſs fragments,</hi> but as the <hi>Fountains of life,</hi> and <hi>health;</hi> as certain pieces God would make inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to <hi>miracles,</hi> and to works above the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54442:90"/> 
                  <hi>power of nature.</hi> Therefore the <hi>Bones</hi> of Holy Perſons endued with <hi>ſuch vertue</hi> may juſtly be qualifyed with <hi>joy,</hi> and conſequently it is not improper to ſay, <hi>That humbled Bones ſhall rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again St. <hi>John Damaſcene</hi> hath a fine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; ſaying, <hi>thoſe who imitate the vertues of Saints, may be more truly ſaid their relicks, or impreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than the lump and maſs of Earth they leave behind.</hi> He who hath the <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>ardours</hi> of a St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Converſion of Souls, may be ſtiled his <hi>lively Image:</hi> Who can claim the <hi>fortitude</hi> of a St. <hi>Stephen</hi> in accepting the <hi>ſtroke of Death for Juſtice ſake;</hi> will infallibly bear the <hi>ſtamp</hi> of that <hi>Protomartyr:</hi> Who can perform the <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> of a St. <hi>Francis,</hi> will prove a better pattern of him, than his own Body, which at this day remains entire at <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of that Glory his Soul enjoyes in Heaven; ſo that when we caſt our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>mould</hi> of their <hi>vertues,</hi> we become their <hi>animated ſtatues,</hi> and make them rejoyce in our <hi>imitation,</hi> as the <hi>Angels</hi> do at a ſinners <hi>Converſion:</hi> it is not unlikely our Holy Prophet alluded to ſuch <hi>living relicks,</hi> vvhen he ſaid <hi>humbled bones ſhall rejoyce.</hi> Since good Men are here for the moſt part crushed in the Worlds eſteem, that values <hi>nothing</hi> but what is great in <hi>vanity:</hi> Yet amidſt theſe Clouds of <hi>oppreſsion,</hi> and <hi>ſcorns</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:54442:91"/> thrown at them, they find within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in performing their <hi>duty</hi> to God, for <hi>the fruit of the ſpirit</hi> (ſayes St. <hi>Paul) is joy, peace,</hi> and a thouſand other content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which attend a ſtate of <hi>innocence;</hi> ſo that it is an ingenious Expreſſion of our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, <hi>that humbled bones ſhall rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have many times wondered, why Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God should give unto the <hi>Aſhes of Saints,</hi> what he had denyed them whilſt they were alive, and made not uſe of any <hi>limb,</hi> or <hi>vital motion</hi> but for his ſake; that is, many <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> have been wrought, by touching the <hi>mouldred duſt</hi> of Saints, who living were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver favoured with the power of any Miracle: but as the <hi>lives of Saints</hi> are admirable, ſo the <hi>proceedings</hi> of Almighty God with them ſeem very <hi>myſterious,</hi> yet I have propoſed ſome <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of this to my ſell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Almighty God will shew by this how dear his Servants are unto him, and if he give ſo much <hi>vertue</hi> to their <hi>Aſhes,</hi> what may we expect he doth to their <hi>Immortal Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> it argues how grateful a thing <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> is in the ſight of God, that thoſe who have Crucifyed their <hi>fleſh,</hi> and daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed their <hi>Bodies</hi> for his name, should have the very <hi>Ashes</hi> of that <hi>Mortified Body,</hi> cure
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54442:91"/> 
                  <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> reſtore <hi>ſight</hi> to the <hi>blind,</hi> and raiſe the <hi>dead</hi> to <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Almighty God will manifeſt the <hi>difference</hi> between a <hi>pampered Body,</hi> and one <hi>mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> by acts of <hi>pennance,</hi> the <hi>one</hi> by all manner of delicacies ſought to preſerve a <hi>beauty,</hi> and make it proof againſt time: Yet once grown old, or cut off by Death it is caſt into obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion; the <hi>other</hi> kept in Chains, and threatned daily with ruine, yet at the laſt proves mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of veneration even unto thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perhaps contemned it.</p>
               <p>You ſee then, how to live in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Men, what Art is to be uſed to raiſe a ſtately ſtructure of our ſelves, the <hi>materials</hi> of this muſt be acts of <hi>Charity</hi> towards our. <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and acts of <hi>ſeverity</hi> towards our <hi>ſelves;</hi> the <hi>Cement</hi> muſt be <hi>Patience, Conſtancy, Reſignation</hi> to God's holy will, and the like; with <hi>theſe</hi> Saints have purchaſed <hi>glory</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before God, and <hi>veneration</hi> amongſt Men, that even <hi>Kings</hi> have crouched with bended knees before their <hi>Aſhes,</hi> who whilſt here <hi>poor Pilgrims</hi> upon Earth were looked upon as <hi>Idiots,</hi> and made as it were the <hi>mockery</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> ſo that <hi>humbled bones</hi> at laſt shall Triumph, and erect their <hi>Trophies,</hi> where they had been made the <hi>ſpoils</hi> of Death.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> affirms the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54442:92"/> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> were ſo powerful, as no <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> wanted there its <hi>remedy,</hi> and this Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he received from thoſe very perſons, who had been the Subject of his miraculous Cures.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> relates of one <hi>Severus</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blind, by touching only the <hi>Casket</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were enchaſed the <hi>relicks</hi> of the Holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs St. <hi>Gervaſius</hi> and <hi>Protaſius,</hi> he recovered his ſight.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> recounts many <hi>miracles</hi> wrought by the <hi>relicks</hi> of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and adds: The benefits obtained at his shrine were ſo great and numerous, as whole Volumes might be filled with the relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In fine,</hi> there is not a Doctour of the Church, whoſe <hi>writings</hi> ſpeak not the <hi>wonders</hi> Heaven hath owned, (even in their time) upon the ſcore of ſupplications made in the preſence and honour of Saints Bodies.</p>
               <p>Nor did this religious Worship of <hi>relicks</hi> ſpring up originally with the Ghoſpel, for St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> brings evidence how the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>Eſay, Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy</hi> were had in great veneration among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and this from the <hi>extraordinary ſuccours</hi> God conſerred on <hi>diſtreſſed People</hi> at the <hi>Tombs</hi> of thoſe Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>We find likewiſe <hi>Exodus</hi> 13. that before
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54442:92"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> conducted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he ordained the Bones of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to be taken up, and born away with <hi>Ceremony</hi> into the Land of promiſe.</p>
               <p>Now why all this? But to verify our Holy <hi>Prophets</hi> aſſertion that <hi>humbled bones shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce;</hi> that Death may cauſe a <hi>ſeparation</hi> twixt <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> and ſo ſeem to Triumph over this <hi>mortal clay</hi> of ours, cannot be denyed: Yet if our <hi>members</hi> have ſerved in purity (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> terms it) and merited in life to be the <hi>Temple</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, ſuch as theſe (though exanimated) may ſtill retain a <hi>vertue</hi> by which they give <hi>life</hi> and <hi>joy</hi> to other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Whence juſtly our <hi>Petitioner</hi> fore-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>and humbled bones ſhall rejoyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truly it is but rational to conceive there should be a <hi>Providence</hi> to preſerve from <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon corruption,</hi> thoſe Bodies who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to many acts of <hi>vertue,</hi> and made a daily <hi>victime</hi> by <hi>pennance:</hi> For ſince <hi>mortality</hi> is the <hi>effect of ſin,</hi> there ought at leaſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that hath the <hi>reſemblance of immortality</hi> to attend that Body, which hath much contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Souls happineſs.</p>
               <p>Beſides, we believe our Bodies shall one day be glorified and veſted with <hi>immortal dotes;</hi> it is fit then ſuch who have here led a <hi>life</hi> as it were <hi>Angelical,</hi> without any contamination
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54442:93"/> of <hi>ſenſual pleaſures,</hi> should anticipate in ſome kind their future <hi>glorifyed condition,</hi> and how can this better appear, than by imprinting a <hi>Sovereign vertue</hi> in their <hi>extinguished Ashes,</hi> ſince it is decreed a <hi>compleat glorification</hi> cannot (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs particularly diſpenſed with) be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till the <hi>univerſal Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This admirable <hi>operation</hi> given to their Earthly and liveleſs ſubſtance, as it is a <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of their Souls felicity, ſo is it no leſs to us a <hi>pledge</hi> the moſt dear we could have, by which we are aſſured of their watchful and compaſſionate care over us. <hi>In fine,</hi> how powerfully are we wrought into the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their <hi>lives,</hi> when at their shrines we behold both <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> vanquished, and the prodigious effects of humbled, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Limbs lowdly declare, <hi>how precious the Death of Saints is in the ſight of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus our Holy Petitioner hath laid open unto us; <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Jubileys of mind</hi> which fill a Soul united unto God by <hi>love</hi> and <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Next,</hi> to compleat the <hi>Harmony,</hi> he tells us our very <hi>bones</hi> shall not want their <hi>portion of joy;</hi> that if they here be made bare, disjoynted, or broken, Almighty God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails to ſweeten thoſe <hi>rigours,</hi> by internal <hi>whiſpers</hi> and <hi>conſolations,</hi> which carry them on to <hi>perſeverance</hi> in their preſſures and debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54442:93"/> and when Saints have once payed this <hi>debt</hi> to <hi>nature,</hi> then he gives to the <hi>one part</hi> the immediate fruition of his Glory, and to the <hi>other</hi> he often communicates ſuch Soveraign vertues, that they are as it were certain previous diſpoſitions to immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, the <hi>relick</hi> of a Saint appears but a <hi>lump of Earth liveleſs, inanimate,</hi> and ſo is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of joy, yet God making it the <hi>inſtrument</hi> of miraculous effects, is thereby glorifyed, and what ever relates to his <hi>honour</hi> is matter of <hi>exultation.</hi> Again, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that every Creature groans;</hi> that is, feels throwes, and longing deſires after their Maker: If then theſe reſentments be allowed to every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much more ought we grant it to the Sacred pledge of a Saints Body, in which the Omnipotency, and other Divine attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God do ſo gloriouſly shine; <hi>and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled bones ſhall rejoyce.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Again our <hi>Penitent</hi> diſcreetly weighed that God hath a Countenance of <hi>Juſtice</hi> as well as <hi>mercy,</hi> to diſpenſe unto his Creatures; that should the former be caſt upon him, he were loſt: For who can ſtand the Face of

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> it deſtroyes Man who is his <hi>lively Image,</hi> and the moſt noble <hi>Maſter-piece</hi> he hath framed in this World, and as a <hi>rare Artiſt</hi> cannot but be incenſed againſt him who ſpoils his <hi>work.</hi> So God frowns at <hi>Sin,</hi> and it appears in his ſight more <hi>horrid</hi> and <hi>execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> than is the <hi>plague, Thunder,</hi> or the moſt <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous beaſt</hi> unto the ſenſe of Man.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Do but imagine (ſays a holy perſon) with what impetuoſity a <hi>rapid ſtream,</hi> that hath for a while been barricado'd up, doth at laſt finding a little paſſage break through and make its way: or a <hi>thunderbolt</hi> which for a time had been hemmed in a <hi>cloud,</hi> with what a <hi>dreadful force</hi> it iſſues forth, deſtroying what ever happens neer unto it: juſt ſo the <hi>anger</hi> of God, when not reſtrained by his <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> ſeiſes upon unfortunate Souls, and inflicts immortal and endleſs <hi>vengeance</hi> upon them: this <hi>anger</hi> in the next life will be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable</hi> never to be moderated in the vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Eternity; for as their <hi>Souls</hi> will be Eternally contaminated with <hi>Sin,</hi> ſo will they be Eternally odious in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>From theſe <hi>conſiderations</hi> our holy peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent grounds his <hi>Suit,</hi> and ſupplicates that his face of <hi>juſtice</hi> may be averted from him; for to be ſtrook with a million of <hi>thunderbolts</hi> would appear but like a <hi>hony dew,</hi> if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the <hi>terrour,</hi> which the <hi>angry looks</hi> of our great and good God will ſtrike into a <hi>Sinner.</hi>

                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:54442:96"/> wrought in him, and that his <hi>vertues</hi> may ſerve as a <hi>veil</hi> caſt over his <hi>ſins;</hi> only he begs further that when he shall deſign deſign him a <hi>glance,</hi> that he would not for all this play the <hi>curious,</hi> and pry too narrowly, but rather the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler,</hi> as if he ſaw no farther than his <hi>penitential groans</hi> and <hi>tears.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Bernard</hi> warrants this deſign of our Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent by his own <hi>experience;</hi> ſaying, <hi>O my God I tranſgreſſed, and thou didſt feign not to be offended, I forbear not my crimes, yet thou didſt forbear thy chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I prolonged, and perſevered in my iniquity, and thou O Lord in thy pitty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next <hi>ſtratagem</hi> is to interpoſe the <hi>amiable perſon</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt; for if <hi>charity cover a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of iniquities,</hi> what a <hi>preſervative</hi> muſt this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred pledge of Heaven needs prove; that <hi>propitiatory Sacrifice</hi> prepared by ſo many <hi>ſufferings,</hi> is a <hi>ſhield</hi> of protection, a <hi>Sanctuary</hi> which the Juſtice of God it ſelf cannot force; hence our Penitent exclaimed; <hi>reſpice in faciem Chriſti tui,</hi> that if the <hi>Head</hi> of Chriſt all Crowned with <hi>Thorns</hi> were interpoſed 'twixt God and a Sinner, it would obſcure and Cloud his <hi>guiltineſs,</hi> that his <hi>all-ſeeing Eye</hi> clogged with <hi>benignity</hi> could not pierce the <hi>traverſe,</hi> nor come to a <hi>ſurvey</hi> of his iniquities. <hi>Turn away thy face from my ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This aſſurance <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet gave
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54442:97"/> him, that his <hi>Sin</hi> was transferred, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Shoulders of that <hi>all-immaculate Lamb,</hi> who was to bear away the <hi>ſins</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> it is then under this <hi>infinite oblation,</hi> and <hi>univerſal expiation</hi> he shrowds his <hi>failings</hi> from the <hi>face</hi> of God.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, in God not to take notice, imports the ſame thing as to <hi>pardon,</hi> nor doth the frequent <hi>proſperity</hi> of wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shake this <hi>Truth,</hi> for every their leaſt <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation</hi> is regiſtred and reſerved till the laſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>account</hi> they are to make, however they here run on without any ſtop, as if the Sage ruler of all things took no cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of their actions, and which is done parhaps from a foreſight they will perſevere to the <hi>end</hi> in <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> and having performed acts of <hi>moral vertues,</hi> God allowes them a little <hi>calm</hi> in this <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in our ſenſe, when God <hi>paſſes over</hi> as undiſcerned our faults, he <hi>remits</hi> them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out punishment, and ſo ſeems to have been a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to our miſdeeds; but yet he never, doth this; that is; never turns away his Face <hi>from</hi> our ſins, unleſs we firſt turn our Face <hi>upon</hi> them, placing them before our Eyes, and touched with a <hi>horrour</hi> at their <hi>deformity,</hi> abjure, and proteſt againſt them; having done this, we muſt then expoſe that <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract</hi>

               <p>Our penitent having in this manner made his way, he hopes the <hi>effect</hi> will follow, that God averting his <hi>Face,</hi> in that act will give him an <hi>abolition</hi> of his <hi>crimes,</hi> that ſo he may reap the <hi>fruit</hi> of a Holy <hi>penitential fear.</hi> We kow St. <hi>Peter</hi> fared not the worſe, when prompted by a <hi>low eſteem of himſelf,</hi> he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lord to <hi>withdraw</hi> from him becauſe a <hi>ſinner:</hi> No more did the <hi>good Centurion</hi> loſe any thing, in acknowledging his little of <hi>merit</hi> to have his <hi>houſe</hi> bleſſed, and made happy by Chriſt's preſence: So our Penitent's <hi>awful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> in declining the <hi>Face</hi> of his Creatour, ſpringing from a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of his own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and believing his <hi>ſins</hi> an <hi>object</hi> unfit for an <hi>Eye</hi> ſo pure and unſtained, may perhaps draw <hi>benedictions</hi> upon him, and contribute in a large meaſure to his <hi>happineſs.</hi> Wherefore he goes on ſtill repeating, <hi>turn away thy face from my ſins.</hi>

               </p>

               <p>St. <hi>Hierom</hi> compares <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> with the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Soul,</hi> for as the <hi>powers,</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties</hi> (which are the inſtrument of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) flow from the <hi>eſſence:</hi> So from <hi>grace</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into the <hi>powers of the Soul</hi> all thoſe vertues by vvhich they are moved and carryed on to what they act. <hi>Grace</hi> then is like a <hi>new Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> vvhich elevates <hi>Man</hi> above his <hi>natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and puts him into a <hi>capacity</hi> of poſſeſſing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54442:103"/> God who is his <hi>ſupernatural end;</hi> and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it ought like a <hi>noble Queen</hi> be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a train of <hi>infuſed habits</hi> of Vertues. The <hi>Theological</hi> furnish us with <hi>wings</hi> to fly in a ſtraight Line unto God; the <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſet us in a juſt comportment of <hi>holineſs</hi> towards our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and our <hi>ſelves:</hi> Nay, when <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace</hi> shall no more be clogged with the Maſs of the <hi>Body,</hi> and relicks of <hi>ſin,</hi> her <hi>laſt operation</hi> will be to produce unto us the <hi>clear viſion</hi> of God, accompanied with <hi>beatifick love;</hi> for the eſſential part of <hi>grace</hi> is the ſame thing with <hi>Glory,</hi> and only diſtinguished like to what is perfect, from that which is leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, or as a thing begun from what is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished and compleat.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Sanctifying Grace</hi> then is the <hi>fountain</hi> our Penitent thirſts after, for the purifying his Heart, and if <hi>once</hi> washed in this <hi>ſtream</hi> he may juſtly call it a <hi>clean heart,</hi> witneſs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>I will ſhower down upon you a pure water, and it will cleanſe you from all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> If this ſtain conſiſt in a perverſe action unretracted, <hi>Sanctifying grace</hi> recalls this <hi>perverſe action</hi> by an <hi>habitual converſion</hi> unto God, and <hi>ſubmiſsion</hi> to his Holy Will. If it ſpeak an <hi>offence</hi> to God, <hi>grace</hi> repairs this <hi>injury,</hi> and makes that <hi>injurious</hi> Action no more <hi>voluntary:</hi> If his <hi>uglineſs</hi> ſpring from an <hi>enmity</hi> with God, <hi>grace</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:54442:104"/> appeaſes all his <hi>anger,</hi> and changes it into a <hi>love of complacence</hi> as a neceſſary effect; not that to love us he hath any <hi>need,</hi> but becauſe a <hi>Soul</hi> enriched with Grace is <hi>juſt,</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> and whileſt it is in ſuch a condition, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but <hi>delight himſelf</hi> in an object ſo worthy and deſerving. If his <hi>deformity</hi> involves an obligation to <hi>eternal puniſhment, grace</hi> clears all that <hi>ſcore,</hi> raiſing a Soul to that degree as she is <hi>worthy</hi> of Heaven: Now 'tis impoſſible that being in a ſtate capable of <hi>enjoying</hi> him, she can be lyable to ſuch a <hi>debt,</hi> wherefore there is <hi>nothing</hi> ſo hideous, and abominable in a <hi>ſinner,</hi> which <hi>grace</hi> doth not deſtroy. Thus you ſee what an <hi>expedient</hi> our Holy Penitent hath pitched upon to arrive by it to his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned purity,</hi> and if he obtain his <hi>demand,</hi> he knowes his <hi>work</hi> is done; that is, the <hi>operation of grace</hi> is ſo infallible, as the <hi>effect</hi> is not to be hindred: For it is not poſſible that a Soul at <hi>the ſame time</hi> can be innocent, and guilty, holy, and impious; have a Right to <hi>Heaven</hi> and lyable to <hi>eternal death:</hi> So that being once drowned in this <hi>purifying Ocean,</hi> he receives a <hi>pledge</hi> of all the <hi>felicity</hi> that either the nature of <hi>Angels</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> is capable off.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected, that our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner may fall short of his <hi>expectation</hi> even though he obtain his <hi>demand:</hi> For we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54442:104"/>

This <hi>poſition</hi> our Penitent admits, knowing that God obliges not himſelf to communicate unto <hi>every Soul</hi> all kind of <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural vertues</hi> as a <hi>neceſſary dependance</hi> on <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace;</hi> but that he diſtributes to <hi>ſome</hi> more to <hi>others</hi> leſs, in reference either to their <hi>want,</hi> their <hi>diſpoſition,</hi> or the <hi>Series</hi> of his Holy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> which deals the <hi>meaſure</hi> of his <hi>favours</hi> according to his <hi>will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having weighed all this, he recollects his <hi>thoughts</hi> as to <hi>his own</hi> particular, and remembers how before he defiled <hi>himſelf</hi> with <hi>ſin.</hi> God had witneſſed a <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> in the choice of <hi>him,</hi> making him the <hi>object</hi> of his moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging <hi>liberalities;</hi> next, he conſiders that when God is pleaſed to ſign his <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>letters of grace</hi> unto a <hi>ſinner,</hi> he doth not only free <hi>him</hi> from <hi>eternal puniſhment</hi> for what is paſt, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores

               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>motive</hi> of this his Petition is, in that the <hi>heart</hi> is the <hi>ſource</hi> of all <hi>evil:</hi> 'Tis from thence that <hi>Homicide, Adultery, Theft,</hi> and other ſins ariſe, which gave occaſion unto

This alone belongs to the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> and in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel to the <hi>Will,</hi> by whoſe direction it is led: It is evident then that on the motion of the <hi>heart</hi> (which expreſſion comprizes the <hi>three faculties</hi> of the Soul as I ſaid in the beginning) depends the <hi>blame,</hi> and <hi>praiſe</hi> of whatſoever we do: For that an <hi>action</hi> may be ſaid to be of Man; the <hi>underſtanding</hi> muſt <hi>firſt</hi> give its <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,</hi> by which he doth it knowingly; <hi>next,</hi> the <hi>will</hi> is to make its <hi>election,</hi> and in that owns its <hi>liberty: Laſtly,</hi> the <hi>memory</hi> is for the moſt part filled with various Images of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Objects, by which it ſolicits the <hi>will</hi> to vain and bad deſires, ſo that, if <hi>theſe</hi> three be <hi>reformed,</hi> he queſtions not but to <hi>deface</hi> all the fantomes and repreſentations of this

               <p>This <hi>ſpiritual rectitude</hi> conſiſts in two heads,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54442:109"/> to wit, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>morality:</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> teaches what we owe to God, the <hi>other</hi> what is due to our <hi>Neighbour</hi> and our <hi>ſelves;</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unto us the <hi>perfections,</hi> and <hi>attributes</hi> of God, and of theſe gives us a moſt certain <hi>knowledge</hi> not lyable to any errour, becauſe it is grounded on the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of God, which is more <hi>infallible</hi> than our <hi>reaſon, ſenſes,</hi> or appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the dead.</p>
               <p>Now that this <hi>certitude</hi> in matter of <hi>Faith</hi> ought to be of all things moſt unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, is evident: For Man is obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God before all created things, to ſet a value upon the <hi>works</hi> of his <hi>ſervice</hi> beyond any proper <hi>intereſt of riches, honour,</hi> nay of <hi>life,</hi> which is frankly to be expoſed in <hi>defiance</hi> of all the <hi>cruelties</hi> that can be inflicted, rather than to fail in the <hi>leaſt tittle</hi> of what <hi>Faith</hi> preſcribes as due to our Creatour: It were then very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere we should be tyed to forfeit what is moſt precious to us in this World, and to ſuſtain that which we moſt abhor, and all this for a thing that is <hi>dubious, uncertain,</hi> and <hi>lyable</hi> to errour. Wherefore in all reaſon the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> we have by <hi>Faith</hi> ought to be the moſt depurated from <hi>droſs of doubt,</hi> or <hi>vacillation:</hi> Now what can be more ſecure and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory than to be taught by God himſelf, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>revelation,</hi> who is a <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream

               </p>
               <p>In other vertues God ſeems to treat with us <hi>familiarly,</hi> and as <hi>equalls,</hi> laying down <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to move us to embrace them; but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Faith</hi> he playes the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, forbids, threatens, promiſes, and delivers things which ſurpaſs all imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this without any <hi>evidence,</hi> or <hi>reaſon</hi> of their exiſtence; now though at the firſt glance this proceeding ſeems harsh, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly weighed it will be found a <hi>ſtroke</hi> of his <hi>goodneſs;</hi> for whilſt we believe amidſt theſe Clouds and obſcurity, it ſpeaks more loud an act of our <hi>free will</hi> which is the <hi>ſpring of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> preſuppoſing the <hi>exiſtence of grace:</hi> For if where we moſt contradict our ſelves, there is a <hi>Subject of greater merit,</hi> certainly in nothing Man doth more deveſt himſelf of his <hi>inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> than in <hi>acts of Faith,</hi> for he renounces his natural way of <hi>knowledge</hi> by <hi>reaſon,</hi> and <hi>ſenſe;</hi> he Sacrifices his <hi>underſtanding</hi> to God's <hi>ſimple word,</hi> and believes all the <hi>greatneſſes</hi> and <hi>wonders</hi> of the <hi>Divine Being,</hi> and <hi>myſterious works,</hi> meerly becauſe <hi>he hath ſaid it.</hi>

               <p>Another <hi>diſmal thought</hi> occurs which eggs him on to this <hi>demand,</hi> and it ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be very <hi>dreadful</hi> to a <hi>ſinner;</hi> that is, there is a <hi>certain period</hi> ſet to every Man's <hi>tranſgreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which is called the <hi>meaſure of his iniquities,</hi> and if this be once compleated, ſuch a <hi>Cloud</hi> of obſtinacy and perſeverance in evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves <hi>him,</hi> as he never will be cheered with the <hi>Sun-ſhine</hi> of God's <hi>mercy:</hi> This <hi>proceeding</hi> hath been <hi>evident</hi> in the downfall of ſeveral Nations and Cities, whoſe <hi>exceſs</hi> of <hi>wickedneſs</hi> hath drawn upon them the <hi>exterminating hand</hi> of God.

               <p>The <hi>next preſage</hi> of Reprobation is <hi>obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> which was laid before him in the perſon of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whoſe <hi>hardned heart</hi> not all the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Moſes,</hi> nor the <hi>prodigious wonders</hi> he wrought, could in the leaſt mollify, nor, work him to the diſmiſſion of God's people: When therefore you behold a perſon ſo bent upon his <hi>wicked wayes,</hi> as no <hi>remonſtrance, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, promiſe</hi> nor <hi>threat</hi> can prevail, you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes) they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to a <hi>reprobate ſenſe,</hi> which inſenſibly and unawares will bring them to <hi>endleſs ruine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Petitioner</hi> cannot likewiſe accuſe himſelf of this prelude to <hi>perdition;</hi> this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Pſalm</hi> (which he compoſed immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the Prophet from the part of God had denounced unto him his <hi>ingratitude</hi>) ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evinces, he was not deaf to the workings of God's <hi>inſpirations,</hi> nor impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable againſt the <hi>power of exciting grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>cauſe</hi> of God's <hi>dereliction</hi> is an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual application</hi> to a <hi>certain ſin,</hi> to which one is ſo faſtned, as his <hi>ordinary grace</hi> hath no <hi>effect</hi> to draw him from it; and God is pleaſed not to <hi>gratify</hi> him with any thing <hi>extraordinary</hi> in punishment of his <hi>tranſgreſsions,</hi> having ſo often abuſed his <hi>mercy:</hi> This <hi>habitual malice</hi> was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54442:118"/> in the <hi>Jews,</hi> who from age to age had <hi>perſecuted</hi> the Prophets, ſent to mind them of their <hi>duties,</hi> inſomuch as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> laid it to their charge, and defied them to name any <hi>one</hi> who had eſcaped their <hi>fury;</hi> and this they continued, untill at laſt they laid their hands on the Saint of Saints <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> after which <hi>Sacrilegious act,</hi> arrived at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt pitch of their <hi>demerits,</hi> they were given up to the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who totally ſubverted their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Penitent had reaſon to hope his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation</hi> was an <hi>effect of frailty</hi> rather than <hi>malice,</hi> having not continued any ſpace without <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> when once his <hi>ſin</hi> was repreſented to him by the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of God's word, yet knowing the <hi>web</hi> of Man's Salvation to be wrapt up in the <hi>ſecret</hi> of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that though he had <hi>revealed</hi> to many of his Servants the <hi>glad tidings</hi> of their <hi>prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination,</hi> yet never had he to any communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the <hi>doom of reprobation,</hi> leſt it might caſt them into <hi>deſpair;</hi> therefore he thinks it the wiſeſt courſe to ſail between <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and in all events to implore, <hi>that he may not be excluded from his ſight.</hi>

               <p>Some again weighing the <hi>ſubſequent verſe,</hi> where our Penitent petitions God <hi>not to take away from him his holy ſpirit,</hi> are of Opinion

               <p>Wherefore our Penitent fears he may have demerited in this Nature, and begs not to be excluded <hi>from his face;</hi> that is, not to be deprived of thoſe <hi>endearments</hi> wherewith he is wont to overwhelm ſuch Souls as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with his <hi>inſpirations;</hi> and if hitherto he hath played the <hi>Coy one,</hi> and ſcorned his <hi>dalliances;</hi> for the future he will change his <hi>humour,</hi> and cherish every the <hi>leaſt motion</hi> of his <hi>dear Creatour:</hi> He will aim at a <hi>perfect reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> of his beloved; in <hi>imitation</hi> of his <hi>wiſdom</hi> he will diſcern <hi>good</hi> from <hi>evil,</hi> and diſtinguish 'twixt the <hi>leſs</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> good alwayes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing that which is beſt.

               <p>Our Holy Penitent well knew the <hi>truth</hi> of this <hi>Divinity</hi> by the <hi>amorous operations</hi> he had once felt within him; for this <hi>great gift</hi> of God was no <hi>ſtranger</hi> to him, whence I wonder not if he court its <hi>preſervation,</hi> ſince in it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the whole <hi>treaſure</hi> of his <hi>immenſe love:</hi> If

               <p>
                  <hi>Another benefit</hi> of this miſſion is, that this <hi>divine ſpirit</hi> communicates <hi>himſelf</hi> unto a <hi>Soul</hi> as her ſole <hi>treaſure,</hi> and appropriated <hi>ſovereign good,</hi> and in ſuch a manner, as she will not only find God <hi>within</hi> her, but likewiſe that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs <hi>to</hi> her as her <hi>proper right,</hi> the ſerious <hi>thought</hi> of which happy <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> muſt doubtleſs much aſſwage all the <hi>bitterneſs of this life.</hi>

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54442:129"/> that they are by the efficacious Will of God tranſmitted to a ſupernatural end, upon which <hi>foundation</hi> are built all the <hi>ſpirituall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> of God towards them, as their <hi>vocation, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,</hi> and <hi>glorification:</hi> From this <hi>Root</hi> ſprings their <hi>calling</hi> to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to be a <hi>member</hi> of Chriſt's true <hi>Church,</hi> by means of which they obtain <hi>grace,</hi> and by the <hi>right uſe</hi> of Grace <hi>eternal glorification:</hi> This muſt give <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>life</hi> to <hi>their joy,</hi> and no leſs to <hi>ours;</hi> as it did to our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> before his <hi>fall,</hi> and now <hi>reſtored</hi> (as he hopes) to the wonted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes of his Creatour, he begins to breath after the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of his <hi>predeſtination,</hi> which had often occaſioned unto him <hi>abundant joy:</hi> Wherefore he cryes, <hi>reſtore unto me the joy of thy Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet whileſt he petitioned for this <hi>ſolid contentment,</hi> he was not ignorant that his <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> muſt proceed from the <hi>merciful hand</hi> of God, and the <hi>Collation of glory</hi> from the intereſt of his own merits: God firſt puts us in an infallible condition to be <hi>happy,</hi> and then ſo tempers the <hi>circumſtances,</hi> as we our ſelves may be a <hi>partial cauſe</hi> of our <hi>happineſs;</hi> he offers the occaſions of <hi>merit,</hi> this done, he ſeconds our <hi>endeavours</hi> ſo powerfully as the <hi>effect;</hi> to wit, <hi>eternal glory</hi> cannot but follow: So that the <hi>joy</hi> he ſues for, is an <hi>aſſurance</hi> to be in the ſtate
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54442:129"/> of <hi>grace</hi> and eternally <hi>predeſtinate;</hi> that be his <hi>combats</hi> and <hi>aſſaults</hi> in this life never ſo <hi>furious,</hi> he shall <hi>overcome:</hi> Be his <hi>temptations</hi> never ſo <hi>vehement,</hi> the <hi>iſſue</hi> will be <hi>glorious,</hi> having his Eyes ſtill fixt upon the <hi>Palms of Beatitude,</hi> the aſſured <hi>guerdon</hi> of his <hi>conflicts,</hi> in caſe, I ſay, he be in the number of the Predeſtinate.</p>
               <p>But as to the infallible decrce of <hi>predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> knowes it is a <hi>ſecret</hi> shut up in the <hi>Cabinet</hi> of his great Councels; the <hi>joy</hi> therefore he aims at here is, that which ariſes from the <hi>mediums</hi> conſequent to our <hi>eternal Election:</hi> For God firſt deſigns our <hi>Beatitude,</hi> and after this the <hi>means</hi> to arrive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, as to have <hi>true faith,</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Commandements,</hi> to avoid <hi>ſin,</hi> to practice <hi>works of mercy,</hi> to have a <hi>ſincere repentance,</hi> a perfect <hi>charity</hi> towards God, and our Neighbour, to bear <hi>adverſity</hi> with <hi>patience,</hi> and finally to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in <hi>grace;</hi> theſe <hi>actions</hi> he knowes are the proper <hi>inſtruments</hi> to cauſe joy within him; in order to this he reſolves upon the punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of his <hi>commands,</hi> and this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly like a <hi>Giant</hi> both with <hi>firm footing,</hi> and with <hi>large</hi> and <hi>nimble paces;</hi> nor will he diſcharge this <hi>Obligation</hi> in a cold manner ſimply to <hi>pay</hi> what he <hi>owes,</hi> but with a ſerious application of his Mind offering them up to <hi>God,</hi> and directing them to his <hi>glory</hi> with a moſt <hi>holy</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:54442:130"/> and <hi>pious zeal:</hi> Next, he reſolves alwayes to do that which is moſt <hi>acceptable</hi> to God, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we cannot give him too much <hi>honour,</hi> and that our <hi>fidelity</hi> engages us not to omit any occaſion of doing good: <hi>Laſtly,</hi> he will be aſſiduous in framing interiour and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour acts of <hi>vertues,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as more immediately lead unto him, he will conſpire with <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>affection</hi> to all the <hi>ſervices,</hi> to all the <hi>acts of love, praiſe</hi> and <hi>glorification,</hi> that the moſt perfect Creatures ever have, or shall give unto him.</p>
               <p>His <hi>next deſign</hi> in purſuance of this <hi>joy</hi> is to have an Eye to <hi>himſelf,</hi> whom he beholds like a <hi>plat of ground,</hi> which muſt be <hi>cultivated,</hi> and emboweld ere it be <hi>fruitful:</hi> He undertakes this <hi>melioration</hi> with the tools of <hi>fortitude, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance,</hi> and other <hi>vertues;</hi> nor is he ſet on work by the <hi>comelineſs of vertue,</hi> or <hi>turpitude of vice;</hi> his <hi>final end</hi> is the <hi>object</hi> of all his motion, it is meerly to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God, and <hi>glorify</hi> him in his <hi>Salvation.</hi> He knowes the condition of this <hi>life</hi> is alwayes beſet with <hi>dangers,</hi> and <hi>haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards</hi> (alas his own <hi>experience</hi> had too freshly taught him this <hi>Truth</hi>) and that we are in the midſt of ſworn <hi>mortal Enemies,</hi> wherefore he is reſolved to bear a <hi>ſtrict band,</hi> and purchaſe <hi>victory</hi> by a perfect abnegation of <hi>himſelf,</hi> of his <hi>ſenſes</hi> both interiour and exteriour, of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54442:130"/> his <hi>memory, underſtanding,</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> knowing it is a <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Tickliſh Combat</hi> to overcome by <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>third contrivance</hi> to <hi>joy</hi> is, not to <hi>fail</hi> in what he <hi>owes</hi> to his <hi>Neighbour:</hi> He conſiders <hi>Man</hi> iſſuing from the hands of God, and in a <hi>capacity</hi> (if faithful to his Graces) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the ſame <hi>fountain:</hi> Wherefore he fears to <hi>hate</hi> that perſon whom God may have deſigned to <hi>love</hi> for eternity, and as he loves <hi>God</hi> not as a <hi>particular,</hi> but <hi>univerſal good,</hi> ſo he will <hi>cheriſh, love,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> all Souls, as being in a <hi>poſsibility</hi> of enjoying him.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>foundation</hi> our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> layes for the <hi>ſuperſtructure</hi> of his <hi>joy;</hi> remitting the reſt to the <hi>diſpoſal</hi> of that all <hi>comprehending Architect,</hi> whoſe <hi>lines</hi> are drawn ſeverally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>rule</hi> of his <hi>providence:</hi> For when a <hi>Soul</hi> whom he hath gratified with <hi>endearments of ſpiritual reliſhes,</hi> and <hi>ineffable delights</hi> happens to <hi>forfeit</hi> by ſome default the <hi>ſubtraction</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> ſometimes upon her <hi>repentance</hi> he not only admits her again to his <hi>favour,</hi> but alſo to her <hi>wonted raviſhments,</hi> nay to that degree as even she ſeems to have <hi>gained</hi> by her <hi>loſs:</hi> Sometimes again he is pleaſed barely to <hi>Seal</hi> his <hi>pardon,</hi> without any further <hi>communication</hi> of thoſe <hi>Enthuſiaſtick throwes,</hi> she uſed to feel in her <hi>amorous tranſports.</hi> Now I find our <hi>Penitent</hi>

               <p>St. <hi>Gregory</hi> puts this <hi>diſtinction</hi> 'twixt <hi>corporal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual pleaſures,</hi> that the former not had, push us on to vehement <hi>deſires</hi> for the <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> but when <hi>enjoyed</hi> they preſently <hi>cloy,</hi> and beget a <hi>nauceouſneſs;</hi> the other give very little <hi>inſentives</hi> when abſent, yet being once poſſeſſed they are ſtill coveted, becauſe ſtill creating <hi>new delights,</hi> and though to be kept in <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> be a kind of <hi>torment</hi> in <hi>Earthly enjoyments,</hi> yet it is not ſo when they relate to <hi>Heavenly treaſures;</hi> the reaſon is, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Earth</hi> for our <hi>hopes,</hi> and <hi>Heaven</hi> for our <hi>bliſs:</hi> If here we are mindful of <hi>Celeſtial glory,</hi> and make it the <hi>ſubject</hi> of our <hi>thoughts,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,</hi> every the leaſt glimmering <hi>hope</hi> of that bleſſed ſtate will produce <hi>ineffable joy</hi> within us.

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54442:134"/> to them <hi>effectively</hi> more <hi>beneficial.</hi> This <hi>poſition</hi> they prove out of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> where Chriſt ſpeaking to a beloved Soul ſayes, <hi>vulnerâſti Cor meum;</hi> that is to ſay, there is not a hair of her <hi>head,</hi> dart of her <hi>Eye,</hi> leaſt motion of her <hi>heart,</hi> or <hi>limb,</hi> which coſt him not a <hi>wound;</hi> becauſe they all import acts of <hi>obedience, humility,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> towards him; and therefore it was a <hi>pleaſing wound,</hi> ſince it was to be to them <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of all their <hi>ſpiritual benedictions:</hi> Whence you may ſee that <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord doth not like <hi>Creatures</hi> who <hi>love</hi> the leſs <hi>thoſe perſons</hi> that have cauſed unto them the <hi>greater ſufferings,</hi> for one act of <hi>gratitude</hi> on our part is of a <hi>vertue</hi> ſo <hi>ſoveraign,</hi> as it heals and cloſes up all his <hi>wounds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then his <hi>paſsion</hi> however <hi>bitter</hi> in it ſelf was made <hi>delightful</hi> to him in regard of the <hi>juſt</hi> whom he foreſaw would make <hi>good uſe</hi> of it; how ought it to <hi>affect</hi> thoſe who reap the <hi>benefit;</hi> it is this <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> after which our <hi>Penitent</hi> aſpires, for in this a <hi>double contentment</hi> arrives to <hi>perfect Souls: Firſt,</hi> in that his <hi>love</hi> made him ſuffer ſo <hi>liberally</hi> for them: <hi>Next,</hi> in that they have <hi>contributed</hi> to allay the <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbities</hi> of his <hi>paſsion,</hi> by the foreknowledge he had of their <hi>compliance</hi> with his <hi>grace.</hi> O what ſolid matter of <hi>joy?</hi> Now you muſt know that our <hi>Penitent</hi> looked upon himſelf
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54442:135"/> aſmuch concerned in the <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>participation</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>merits,</hi> as thoſe who were to live after his <hi>comming</hi> and <hi>viſible appearance</hi> upon Earth.

               </p>
               <p>Again, our <hi>Penitent</hi> is animated to this his <hi>petition</hi> upon the conſideration, that when a <hi>perfect Soul</hi> whom God hath deſigned to <hi>ſalvation</hi> falls into any <hi>notable default</hi> (as she may, not being impeccable) he lets her not lye mired in the <hi>filth of ſin</hi> without any feeling of her condition, but preſently ſolicits her with his <hi>exciting graces,</hi> and this with ſuch <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi> as he told St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it was hard for him to play the <hi>obſtinate</hi> againſt ſo many <hi>darts</hi> of his <hi>love,</hi> and if ever that <hi>parable</hi> was fulfilled, where out Saviour having found the <hi>loſt ſheep,</hi> witneſſes more <hi>joy</hi> for the <hi>recovery of that one,</hi> than of the <hi>Ninety nine</hi> he had left in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54442:135"/> it is certainly in the <hi>reſettlement</hi> of a <hi>Soul</hi> in his <hi>favour,</hi> whom he hath marked out to be his: 'Tis true, ſometimes Almighty God withdraws his <hi>ſuſtaining hand,</hi> and permits them to dash upon the <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>offence,</hi> ſo to humble them; that <hi>ſin</hi> might effect what his <hi>Grace</hi> could not, yet the <hi>concluſion</hi> is alwayes to their greater good; and if he makes uſe of ſo many <hi>ſtratagems</hi> to bring them to their <hi>former ſtate</hi> of <hi>happineſs,</hi> being once re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>When I read <hi>this clauſe,</hi> it minds me of what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that <hi>where ſin hath abounded, there Grace doth many times ſuperabound:</hi> For doubtleſs nothing adds <hi>wings</hi> to the <hi>fervour</hi> of a <hi>true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> like to the <hi>remembrance</hi> of their <hi>paſt failings,</hi> whence I gather our <hi>Petitioner,</hi> upon theſe <hi>ſeeds</hi> of his <hi>reſtauration,</hi> will add a <hi>ſuperſtructure</hi> of <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Divinity,</hi> and raiſe himſelf to as high a pitch of <hi>

               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>myſtick Divinity</hi> is defined an <hi>experimental knowledge</hi> of God, ariſing from a moſt <hi>elevated union</hi> of the <hi>will</hi> with him: For the <hi>will</hi> is the <hi>Organ</hi> of a <hi>ſpiritual relliſh,</hi> by which Man taſtes the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> of God, and by this <hi>experience</hi> teaches the <hi>underſtanding</hi> what God is: Now this <hi>ſavour, taſt,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual feeling</hi> may be ſaid to be a kind of <hi>knowing;</hi> becauſe <hi>love</hi> it ſelf according to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is a <hi>knowledge;</hi> but a <hi>knowledge</hi> ſo <hi>ſecret</hi> as <hi>unintelligible</hi> to any but the perſon in whom it is; as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid of a <hi>ſmart pain,</hi> none can ſo juſtly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> it as he that <hi>ſuffers.</hi> Now our <hi>Penitent</hi> thirſts after this <hi>banquet,</hi> he knowes it forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and confirms a Soul in the <hi>practice of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and at a pinch ſuſtains her in the rude <hi>combats of temptations:</hi> For being <hi>united</hi> unto God, she is above all the <hi>attractives,</hi> and <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Creatures:</hi> So that enjoying this <hi>delicious gueſt</hi> by an <hi>experimental knowledge,</hi> there is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nothing in this World of force to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate her from God: This <hi>Job</hi> ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate Chap. 1. <hi>Place me near to thee, and I fear

               </p>
               <p>As this <hi>ſecurity</hi> muſt needs give <hi>birth</hi> to continual <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>joy:</hi> No leſs are the <hi>raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which overwhelm a Soul in the <hi>practice</hi> of this <hi>devotion;</hi> for it is a certain lively <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment</hi> of God's intimate <hi>preſence,</hi> of his <hi>eſſence,</hi> of his <hi>perfections</hi> and <hi>divine operations;</hi> and this with an <hi>experimental affection</hi> or <hi>ſtrong aſſurance</hi> that we love God, that we make his <hi>glory</hi> our <hi>intereſt,</hi> that by <hi>complacence</hi> and <hi>friendſhip</hi> we share in what he hath, it being the Nature of <hi>true love</hi> to make all things <hi>common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt effect</hi> is to work a compleat <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſie</hi> in us; for to <hi>transform</hi> a thing, is to <hi>ſeparate</hi> it from its <hi>natural form,</hi> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate another not only <hi>interiour</hi> but <hi>exteriour:</hi> Now when a Soul is arrived to a <hi>holy compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence</hi> in God, and to a <hi>ſtrict amity</hi> with him, she is deveſted of the <hi>form</hi> of <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>vitious affections,</hi> which was her <hi>natural inclination,</hi> and receives within the Center of her <hi>heart,</hi> new <hi>affections, deſires</hi> wholly Divine, and <hi>motions</hi> quite different from what <hi>Nature</hi> prompts her to: This made St. <hi>Paul</hi> cry <hi>I live now, not I, but Chriſt doth live in me;</hi> and this ſame <hi>motive</hi> gave life to our Petitioners <hi>preſent addreſs,</hi> that

               <p>
                  <hi>Another effect</hi> of this <hi>ſpirit</hi> is to ſettle the Soul in a great <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>repoſe,</hi> free from all <hi>joy, grief</hi> or the like; for every thing is at <hi>reſt</hi> when in its <hi>proper place</hi> and <hi>center:</hi> Now God is our Souls <hi>final end,</hi> nor can <hi>ſhe</hi> be more <hi>intimately united</hi> unto <hi>him</hi>

               <p>This is then the <hi>firſt leſſon</hi> our <hi>Convert</hi> will read unto the <hi>wicked,</hi> that the <hi>decrees</hi> of God touching the worlds <hi>Government</hi> as they are <hi>eternal,</hi> ſo are they <hi>immutable.</hi> If ſome be <hi>fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> through want of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat,</hi> others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain do melt with the <hi>exceſs</hi> of both, yet will he not for all this alter the Sun's <hi>courſe;</hi> if ſome do abuſe <hi>free will,</hi> and by it work their own <hi>deſtruction,</hi> this <hi>inconveniency</hi> will not make him <hi>change</hi> what he hath done, nor <hi>abrogate</hi> that noble <hi>priviledge.</hi> Though <hi>heaven</hi> should become a <hi>deſart,</hi> yet will he not <hi>people</hi> it but with ſuch as <hi>merit</hi> it by a <hi>good life;</hi> I mean in perſons grown up to the <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>reaſon,</hi> however foolish <hi>intoxicated brains</hi> may quarrel his <hi>conduct</hi> (as they do) in many of theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>The <hi>next Lecture</hi> our <hi>Convert</hi> will hold forth unto the <hi>wicked,</hi> and mark out to them the <hi>track</hi> of <hi>heaven,</hi> is, that this <hi>ſupream Lord</hi> hath imprinted in every man a <hi>law</hi> of <hi>reaſon;</hi> by which if he ſquare not his <hi>actions,</hi> his own <hi>reaſon</hi> will riſe up againſt him, play the <hi>judge,</hi> and condemn him: This <hi>light</hi> tells us we muſt fly what is <hi>evil in it ſelf,</hi> and embrace that <hi>good</hi> which is ſo intrinſick to our <hi>natures,</hi> as its <hi>contrary</hi> is <hi>abſolutely evill:</hi> As for example, <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54442:142"/> God</hi> is a thing ſo correſponds with <hi>Mans reaſon,</hi> as were there no <hi>ſuperiour command</hi> to do it, yet our own <hi>judgement</hi> could not but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it as proper and fitting to be done; both in conſideration of Man's <hi>infirmity</hi> and <hi>vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as alſo in relation to the <hi>greatneſs</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity</hi> of God. This <hi>light</hi> is ſo univerſally ſpread, that ſcarce any can be found ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage, who knows and performs not good in ſome kind or other: St. <hi>Paul</hi> confirms this doctrine <hi>ad Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>The Gentils ignorant both of the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>and the goſpel do naturally diſcharge ſome part of the Law,</hi> that is, of <hi>nature;</hi> whence St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> cryes out, <hi>O God your Law is written in our hearts, which no iniquity can raze out.</hi> Hence ſprings a <hi>remorſe</hi> of <hi>conſcience</hi> even in the moſt barbarous perſons, after the perpretation of any <hi>crime</hi> oppoſite to the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and which ſooner or later never fails to ſeize them with <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of the <hi>divine juſtice,</hi> but eſpecially when <hi>grace</hi> (of which no man is altogether and always deſtitute) awakens their drowzy and extinguished <hi>conſcience:</hi> this I ſay ever gives them ſome light ſpark of <hi>knowledge,</hi> by which their firſt <hi>inconſiderate act</hi> is rendred leſs <hi>excuſable.</hi> Thus our brave <hi>combatant</hi> beats the <hi>wicked</hi> with their own <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,</hi> and evidently <hi>demonſtrates</hi> (referring all to their own conſcience) that when
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54442:143"/> they prevaricate by <hi>injuſtice, falſhood, irreverence</hi> to God, <hi>impenitency</hi> and the like; they act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a <hi>Law-giver</hi> which is God himſelf; and againſt a <hi>Law</hi> that took birth with their <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and is the <hi>Model</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>humane Lawes,</hi> which (without conformity to this Law) are not <hi>Lawes,</hi> but <hi>injuſtice</hi> and <hi>tyranny: I will teach the wicked thy wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third remonſtrance</hi> of our enflamed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour is, to inform the wicked that <hi>poſitive Divine Lawes</hi> are neceſſary, not only to <hi>rectify</hi> their <hi>wandring ſteps,</hi> but alſo to <hi>preſerve</hi> the <hi>juſt</hi> in their <hi>righteous paths.</hi> The reaſon is, <hi>Man</hi> is deſigned to a <hi>ſupernatural end,</hi> to arrive at which his <hi>natural faculties</hi> are deficient, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was requiſite he should have <hi>ſupernatural precepts</hi> and <hi>rules</hi> proportioned to the <hi>ſublime con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of his <hi>end:</hi> Beſides, after he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed a ſtate of <hi>innocency</hi> for that of <hi>ſin,</hi> and <hi>corruption;</hi> he ſtood in need of a <hi>Maſter</hi> who might <hi>inſtruct</hi> him how diſaſtrous a thing <hi>ſin</hi> is, how neceſſary to have a <hi>redeemer,</hi> all which <hi>Divine Lawes</hi> do open unto him. Again, to obſerve even the <hi>Lawes</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> would have been a <hi>hard task;</hi> if he aſpired not after ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſublime; for the <hi>efforts</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> are ſo clogged by the <hi>violence</hi> of his <hi>paſsions,</hi> and his <hi>nature</hi> ſo weakned by <hi>ſin,</hi> that unleſs <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine poſitive laws</hi> had engaged man unto <hi>heavenly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54442:143"/> purſuits,</hi> ſcarce would he ever have been able to reach the <hi>perfect obſervance</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Laſtly, it was neceſſary he should have alwayes before his Eyes his <hi>dependency</hi> and <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> unto God, ſo to be ſtirred up to the <hi>performance</hi> of his <hi>duty,</hi> and by giving <hi>teſtimony</hi> of his <hi>faithful obedience</hi> merit ſomething at his hands; wherefore his <hi>Creation</hi> was no ſooner finished, but God laid a <hi>command</hi> upon him, that he might know even in <hi>Paradiſe</hi> he had a <hi>Maſter.</hi> Next, he conſecrated the <hi>Seventh day</hi> to works of his <hi>ſervice,</hi> obliging the firſt inhabitants of the Earth to its <hi>obſervance:</hi> Moreover, thoſe firſt Men of the World were obliged to the <hi>ſupernatural vertues</hi> of <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> without which acts they could not be ſaved; now thoſe <hi>decrees</hi> were <hi>poſitive Lawes,</hi> and ſuperadded to <hi>thoſe</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> ſo that in all times Men were never left <hi>purely</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> but it was intermixed with ſeveral <hi>poſitive ordinations,</hi> that might help them on more <hi>advantagiouſly</hi> in the way of their Salvation.</p>
               <p>Our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> having thus expoſed before the wicked the <hi>endearing providence</hi> of God over mankind, who never abandoned them to the <hi>ſole inſtinct</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of their own <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but like a <hi>careful Maſter</hi> teaching them his <hi>will</hi> by himſelf, and give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </p>
               <p>For without <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> our <hi>works</hi> are not <hi>meritorious;</hi> nor can they <hi>ſatisfy</hi> for any <hi>venial ſin:</hi> Wherefore <hi>deprived of grace</hi> by <hi>original ſin,</hi> we could not by our ſelves (no not by the aſſiſtance of the bleſſed Angels) <hi>ſatisfy</hi> for the leaſt <hi>venial ſin:</hi> Becauſe, though they be <hi>endued</hi> with <hi>grace,</hi> yet no pure Creature can <hi>merit</hi> condign grace: Wherefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> should make <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for our leaſt failing, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently

               <p>To bring this a little more home, St. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſayes the <hi>paſsion</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt is like to a <hi>ray</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which though it be created for the <hi>benefit</hi> of the <hi>whole World,</hi> yet all reap not advantage by it, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of a <hi>melancholy reſerved humour</hi> who effect <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and shut up their <hi>doors</hi> and

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Our Learned <hi>Doctor</hi> upon theſe grounds hath <hi>reaſon</hi> to <hi>hope,</hi> that when he shall have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphered unto the <hi>wicked</hi> the <hi>wayes</hi> of God; how full of <hi>mercy,</hi> and <hi>obliging ſweetneſs</hi> they are, they will lend their <hi>cooperation</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to the <hi>movings</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> bear part with their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>paſsion,</hi> that they may likewiſe share in his <hi>glory,</hi> acknowledging with <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi> all that is done, or to be done by them, the <hi>effects</hi> of his <hi>grace,</hi> and ſo apply to themſelves Chriſt's <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction: And the impious ſhall be converted to thee.</hi>

               <p>When I read a paſſage in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> Chap. 7. it appears terrible the <hi>reſentment</hi> God entertains of <hi>Adultery:</hi> He there ſayes, if the <hi>Husband</hi> be in the number of the <hi>faithful,</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> of the <hi>unfaithful,</hi> he shall <hi>not diſmiſs</hi> her: But if she be <hi>unfaithful</hi> to his <hi>bed,</hi> then he may <hi>lawfully forſake</hi> her; ſo that God ſeems to be more offended, in that she keeps not her <hi>ſaith</hi> with her <hi>Husband,</hi> than in being <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyal</hi> to <hi>him,</hi> inſinuating by this that he will give <hi>no quarter</hi> to an <hi>adulterous act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How <hi>odious</hi> this Crime is to <hi>humane Society</hi> appears, in that the <hi>Civil Law</hi> permits the <hi>Father</hi> or <hi>Husband</hi> of the <hi>Adultereſs</hi> (if taken in the fact) to offer <hi>violent hands,</hi> and immediately deſtroy <hi>both the offendours;</hi> and though the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> ſeem to diſallaw of <hi>this Law</hi> as <hi>unjuſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it precipitates the <hi>guilty</hi> into an <hi>evident hazzard</hi> of their <hi>eternal Salvation:</hi> Yet ſtill it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, how monſtrous an <hi>exorbitancy</hi> Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is in the judgements of Men, when to

                  <hi>Adultery</hi> is a <hi>commerce</hi> between perſons who are <hi>not</hi> linked together in a <hi>conjugal tye,</hi> and from thence it is cloathed with the <hi>turpitude</hi> of <hi>fornication,</hi> and is a <hi>ſin</hi> againſt <hi>charity: Next,</hi> it is a <hi>violation</hi> of a <hi>bond indiſſoluble,</hi> by which the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> hath united one to another, and ſuperadded to fortify this Chain the <hi>bleſsing,</hi> and <hi>vertues</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> in favour of this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> teaches, that God <hi>by it</hi> beſtowes a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grace;</hi> that as in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we purchaſe as it were a <hi>new Being,</hi> regenerated and born to a <hi>ſpiritual life;</hi> as in confirmation we receive a Grace ſtrengthening us in our <hi>Faith;</hi> as in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> an encreaſe of <hi>heavenly bleſsings</hi> is showred down upon us the like in the reſt of the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> So in <hi>that</hi> of <hi>marriage</hi> a <hi>grace</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated which perfits, and refines the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural love</hi> they bare to one another before they married: Inſomuch as <hi>that</hi> love which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was perhaps ſeated in ſome <hi>corporeal charm</hi> or <hi>grace,</hi> afterwards becomes wholly ſacred, and no attractive appears, which carries not along with it a <hi>pious allurement,</hi> and which makes them (whileſt they tread the paths of vertue) to have a <hi>horrour</hi> of any thing that

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arauſican</hi> Councel chap. 28. declares that a <hi>recompence</hi> is due to <hi>good works,</hi> but <hi>grace</hi> (which is not due) muſt go <hi>before</hi> and give <hi>life to</hi> them; and truly it is <hi>rational,</hi> that ſince God threatens <hi>puniſhment</hi> to the <hi>wicked deeds</hi> of Men, he should likewiſe propoſe a <hi>recompence</hi> to <hi>vertuous actions;</hi> otherwiſe he might be ſaid to be more enclined to <hi>ſeverity</hi> than <hi>ſweetneſs,</hi> which is much <hi>repugnant</hi> to his <hi>nature.</hi>

                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> ſanctifying Grace is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God unto a Soul with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an <hi>affectionate Amity,</hi> by which in the firſt place he loves her, and this love of <hi>friendſhip</hi> moves him to pardon all her <hi>offences,</hi> to receive her into his <hi>favour,</hi> and adorn her with the <hi>incomparable Ornament</hi> of this <hi>Celeſtial quality.</hi> This done, Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Friend</hi> of God in his <hi>firſt juſtification,</hi> is

Wherefore that Man may have an unqueſtionable <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Heaven</hi> by the <hi>value</hi> of his <hi>good works</hi> (being ſo engaged to God as he is) it was neceſſary a <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>ſtipulation</hi> should paſs, by which God should pleaſe to declare he would give him <hi>Heaven</hi> in <hi>recompence,</hi> and upon this <hi>ground</hi> he should have a <hi>title</hi> to demand and obtain it.</p>
               <p>In this proceeding his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> meet, his <hi>mercy</hi> in that he accepts the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>juſt,</hi> for more than the <hi>bare diſcharge</hi> of their <hi>obligations:</hi> His <hi>Juſtice</hi> in that he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give the rate of <hi>Heaven</hi> in return of their

               <p>The <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God beholds Creatures in three ſeveral relations: Firſt, it is <hi>diſtributive,</hi> by which he allots unto every Creature <hi>facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> proportionable to carry them on to the <hi>End</hi> for which they were created. To the <hi>Soul</hi> which he hath deſigned to <hi>contemplate</hi> and <hi>love</hi> him, he hath given an <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>will;</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> doomed to <hi>labour</hi> he hath fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Arms,</hi> and <hi>Hands:</hi> The <hi>Sun</hi> whoſe Office is to enlighten the World, he hath veſted with a <hi>laſting brightneſs,</hi> which never fails to perform its task; <hi>in fine,</hi> every <hi>animal, Tree, Plant,</hi> or what ever is exiſtent in the World hath a <hi>vertue</hi> proper to the deſignment of its <hi>Creation.</hi> Whence St. <hi>Dennis</hi> ſayes, <hi>that God is communicable in his Juſtice, diſtributing to every one according to the dignity of its nature, and bounding within limits moſt equitable, the manner, beauty, order, Ornament; the inequalities and proportions of all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, accommodating every thing with that which is proper to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Penitent</hi> will not be ſilent in order to this his <hi>diſtributive Iuſtice,</hi> he will admire the <hi>works</hi> of God, give his approbation without the leaſt Cenſure, and confeſs that this <hi>wiſe Architect</hi> hath ballanced all things with <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>juſtice;</hi> and if he may be ſo happy as to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54442:166"/> manage his <hi>individual Being</hi> conformably to thoſe <hi>proprieties</hi> and <hi>qualities</hi> he hath received from his Creatour, he will with confidence proclaim, <hi>that his tongue ſhall exalt his juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſecond conſideration his <hi>punitive juſtice</hi> hath place, by which he inflicts a <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> on ſinners, the reaſon of this is, that a <hi>ſinner</hi> living contrary to the <hi>wil</hi> of God, and diſobedient to his <hi>order,</hi> ſetling his <hi>contentment</hi> on things forbidden by his Sovereign, doth by theſe his wayes throw a <hi>contempt</hi> upon him: Wherefore it is moſt juſt <hi>reparation</hi> should be made; and ſince he hath rebelled in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Commands</hi> of his Creatour, it is fit he should be afflicted with <hi>torments,</hi> and enſlaved by that <hi>will</hi> he hath ſo much ſcorned, and ſet at naught. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſayes, <hi>the Law is juſt which impoſes on Criminalls a puniſhment they merit; and that Iudge is upright and good who ſpares not offendours; becauſe the chaſtiſement of the wicked, is a preſervation of the good.</hi> So God is not blamable if he fall heavy upon the <hi>wicked,</hi> that they may no longer oppreſs and injure the <hi>innocent,</hi> for it would not be a <hi>vertue</hi> in God to behold his <hi>Servants</hi> in this great World tread his <hi>Lawes</hi> under foot, blaſpheme his <hi>Holy Name,</hi> thwart in every thing his <hi>Sacred will,</hi> commit exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies of all kind, and amidſt all theſe <hi>diſorders,</hi> remain as <hi>ſtupid</hi> and <hi>incenſible:</hi> No, no,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54442:167"/> God hath a <hi>vertue dreadful</hi> to the <hi>impious,</hi> which is his <hi>avenging Iuſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Penitent</hi> finds here likewiſe matter enough for his Tongue, that God having had ſo much reaſon to execute his <hi>Juſtice,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>criminal Head,</hi> hath yet been pleaſed to hold <hi>in</hi> his Thunderbolts, as that they have not (as he deſerved) reduced him to ashes. Wherefore he will amend his <hi>life</hi> ſo to avoid the <hi>terrours</hi> of this <hi>dreadful power,</hi> and if he be not for the future led by the <hi>charms</hi> of his <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> unto the <hi>obſervance</hi> of his <hi>lawes,</hi> then he will ſubmit to this his <hi>punitive right,</hi> it being juſt he should not forfeit it upon his ſcore, or <hi>that</hi> of any unrepenting ſinner: So that in all events, <hi>his Tongue ſhall exalt thy Juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third reflection of God's <hi>Iuſtice</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Creatures is ſtyled <hi>remunerative,</hi> by which he fills with ineffable and endleſs joy, ſuch as have ſerved him faithfully in this life; for as it becomes not his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to let the <hi>infringers</hi> of his <hi>Lawes</hi> to the laſt go <hi>unpun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed,</hi> no leſs is it ſutable to his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> not to reward the <hi>obedient ſervices</hi> of his <hi>Friends.</hi> They have ſtudied here to <hi>pleaſe</hi> him, to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> themſelves to his deſires, and <hi>promote</hi> his Glory as much as lay in them: Nay, were it poſſible to make any addition to his treaſure
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54442:167"/> and perfections, they would have done it. Wherefore their <hi>good God</hi> being <hi>invincible,</hi> and not to be overcome by the good will or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any Creature, thinks himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to confer by way of <hi>recompence</hi> eternal honour, riches, and joyes unto thoſe Souls who have her <hi>ſerved,</hi> and <hi>gloryfied</hi> him by their <hi>vertuous actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>penitent</hi> laies hold on this <hi>juſtice,</hi> and and it is the great Theam on which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes here to dilate himſelf: but whilſt he is buſied in this his <hi>duty,</hi> he is confounded to conſider, that all he can poſſibly give to God, is a <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>ſimple good will,</hi> the <hi>plenitude</hi> of his <hi>perfections</hi> admitting no <hi>encreaſe;</hi> but on the other ſide, <hi>he</hi> receives effective and ſolid bleſſings: God draws <hi>no profit</hi> out of our <hi>good works,</hi> yet he ſets ſuch a <hi>value</hi> on them, as to think <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf not too great a <hi>price</hi> for them: We can only glorifie him in the <hi>film,</hi> or <hi>outſide,</hi> by witneſſing an <hi>eſteem</hi> we have for his <hi>ſervice,</hi> but he glorifies us <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately,</hi> and to the loweſt Center of our Soul, which he will replenish with <hi>ſplendour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> and <hi>glory;</hi> and all theſe great things he will not do <hi>gratis,</hi> as a <hi>favour</hi> at <hi>diſcretion,</hi> but by <hi>vertue</hi> of an <hi>engagement,</hi> and under a <hi>title</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that we might more firmly <hi>hope</hi> for our <hi>felicity,</hi> and <hi>poſſeſs</hi> it in the moſt noble

               <p>It is ſtoried of <hi>Creeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſeeing a City wherein he was beſieged, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked, and forcibly entered by <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> he reſolved rather than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>ſcornful priſoner</hi> to <hi>dye</hi> on the places, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which deſign he caſt himſelf into the <hi>midſt</hi> of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> preferring an <hi>honorable death</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an <hi>opprobrious life:</hi> His Son beholding his <hi>imminent danger,</hi> though to that inſtant at the Age of twenty years he had been alwayes <hi>dumb;</hi> cryed out, <hi>ſpare my Father, ſpare my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is the King:</hi> Whereupon the <hi>Enemy</hi> ſeiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>perſon,</hi> and preſerved his <hi>life,</hi> ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this to a <hi>natural cauſe,</hi> alledging the <hi>love</hi> this <hi>Prince</hi> had for his <hi>Father,</hi> put all his <hi>vital ſpirits</hi> into <hi>combuſtion,</hi> and by that <hi>violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> broke the <hi>obſtacle</hi> of his <hi>ſpeech.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However methinks this <hi>paſſage</hi> may in ſome ſenſe be applyed to our great <hi>Penitent,</hi> who was <hi>morally dumb,</hi> the <hi>Organs</hi> of his Soul ſtructed by the <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>ſin;</hi> inſomuch as he could not utter <hi>one ſyllable,</hi> which might have <hi>force</hi> to reach the <hi>Ears</hi> of his <hi>Creatour;</hi> untill he came to have a proſpect of his <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ruine,</hi> and no ſooner theſe <hi>Terrours</hi> appeared before him, but all the <hi>faculties</hi> of his <hi>Soul</hi> were ſtirred up, removed all Obſtacles, and made him <hi>Petition</hi> for the
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54442:170"/> opening his <hi>Lips,</hi> the <hi>firſt motion</hi> to his <hi>happineſs. Lord thou wilt open my Lips;</hi> For this imports not a <hi>local diviſion</hi> of the <hi>Lips,</hi> but an <hi>inflamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>heart,</hi> by vertue of which <hi>heat,</hi> all the parts of his Body will be diſpoſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thoſe <hi>functions</hi> for which they were created.</p>
               <p>St <hi>Paul</hi> to shew how little Man can do if left to himſelf, ſayes, 1 Cor. 4. <hi>What do we poſſeſs which we have not received, and if ſo, why glory we in it as if our own.</hi> Again, he powerfully aſſerts it in the Eighth Chapter to the <hi>Romans, It is not he who wills, or runs, but he on whom God will have mercy.</hi> As if he would ſay, as <hi>Eſau</hi> in vain purſued his <hi>Chaſe,</hi> thinking from thence to derive to himſelf his <hi>Fathers bleſsing:</hi> So <hi>Man</hi> after ſin loſes but his time, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, if he think by the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural faculties</hi> to be able to obſerve the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements</hi> of God, or perform what is <hi>requiſite</hi> to the <hi>purchaſe</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> So that it muſt chiefly ſpring from the <hi>mercy</hi> of God's <hi>aſsiſting grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, which is more, we cannot ſo much as deſire to ſerve God according to our <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> unleſs he firſt by his <hi>divine grace</hi> move our <hi>hearts,</hi> and diſpoſe our <hi>will</hi> unto it; as the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, <hi>God works in us both the will and the execution;</hi> without God aſſiſting,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54442:170"/> we cannot have a <hi>deſire</hi> neither to <hi>believe</hi> what is propoſed as the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor <hi>perform</hi> what we should in order to <hi>vertuous actions;</hi> and therefore St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, the <hi>prodigal Son</hi> had never reſolved to <hi>return</hi> home to his <hi>Father,</hi> if the <hi>mercy</hi> of God had not <hi>inſpired</hi> him to it.</p>
               <p>To manifeſt <hi>this truth</hi> we need go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to caſt our thoughts upon the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> learning, which produced the <hi>greateſt wits</hi> in the World; yet in all their inquiſition after a <hi>ſovereign good,</hi> they were ſo loſt as even to become <hi>ridiculous;</hi> acting things concerning a <hi>Deity,</hi> and Man's <hi>ſupream felicity,</hi> as if they were <hi>deſtitute</hi> of <hi>reaſon.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> takes notice in particular, how coming to <hi>Athens</hi> he found an <hi>Altar dedicated to an unknown God:</hi> For they had been viſited with a great <hi>peſtilence,</hi> and ignorant for what offence a <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement ſo ſevere</hi> was inflicted; at laſt, fancied it was for want of <hi>homage</hi> to be rendered to <hi>ſome Deity</hi> not yet diſcovered; than this what could be more abſurd, to shew in what <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>errours,</hi> Man doth grope when left to himſelf.</p>
               <p>So that if at any time a perſon <hi>bluſhes</hi> at his <hi>vanities</hi> and paſt extravagancies, and doth <hi>confeſs</hi> that what before he behold as <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> to be nothing elſe than <hi>obſcurity</hi> and <hi>death;</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:54442:171"/> this <hi>Converſion</hi> (ſayes St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) comes not from <hi>himſelf,</hi> but from the <hi>powerful,</hi> and <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den grace</hi> of God which diſſipates the <hi>Clouds</hi> of <hi>Earthly opinions,</hi> and enflames his <hi>heart</hi> with a <hi>deſire</hi> of knowing the <hi>truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>this change</hi> God works in Souls ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes, in ſome more <hi>gently,</hi> in others more <hi>forcibly: Solomon</hi> inſinuates that he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly gives his <hi>call</hi> by the <hi>outward preaching</hi> of his <hi>word;</hi> this <hi>Eſai.</hi> confirms Chap. 40. <hi>God hath ſent Doctors of his Faith into the World, who ſhould reduce their Brethren like the blind into the way;</hi> that is, unto Jeſus Chriſt the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> who is ſtyled the <hi>way, truth, and life.</hi> In this manner <hi>Surius</hi> recounts <hi>Barlaam</hi> was ſent to <hi>Joſaphat</hi> Son to a King in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that by his <hi>converſion</hi> the <hi>whole Kingdom</hi> might embrace the <hi>Law of Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to <hi>Athens,</hi> who converted the great St. <hi>Dennis</hi> a famous Doctor of the <hi>Areopagites.</hi> St. <hi>Philip</hi> to the <hi>Eunuch</hi> of the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Queen, who by expounding unto him a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of Chriſt in <hi>Eſai.</hi> immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Baptiſm</hi> at his hands.</p>
               <p>In the Hiſtory of <hi>Japonia</hi> it is related of a certain <hi>Indian</hi> who had lived well according to the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> how he was reſtleſs in his Mind, believing his <hi>religion</hi> to be falſe: he went to the <hi>Turks</hi> thinking to follow theirs, but finding there no <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> then he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54442:171"/> himſelf to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in perplexity, ſo that with much fervour he was wont to cry out; <hi>O God, let me know who thou art, and that I may ſerve thee according to thy will, otherwiſe do not charge me with blame for my errour.</hi> At laſt it happened St. <hi>Francis Xavierus</hi> came into the Town where he was, and no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did he hear him unfold the points, and ſacred myſteries of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but he proclaimed, <hi>that Man preaches the God I muſt ſerve,</hi> and forth with was baptized.</p>
               <p>By this expedient he likewiſe made a conqueſt of our Holy <hi>Penitent,</hi> in which acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet was inſtrumental, who laying before him his <hi>obligations</hi> to God and his <hi>ingratitude,</hi> occaſioned that without delay he had recourſe to the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of this preſent petition or <hi>Miſerere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond manner of his call is by the <hi>inward operation</hi> of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and this he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates to all, witneſs St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. <hi>God who drew light from darkneſs by a word from his mouth, hath filled our hearts with the ſplendour of his knowledge:</hi> For without this light of <hi>Faith,</hi> Man knowes not God who made him, he knowes not whither he tends; he knowes not <hi>eternal felicity,</hi> for which he was created; nay he knowes not himſelf; for without <hi>Faith,</hi> we know not that we are born <hi>Imps</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:54442:172"/> of <hi>wrath,</hi> and lyable to <hi>eternal death:</hi> We know not the <hi>wounds</hi> of our <hi>nature,</hi> our inability to good, the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of being regenerated by <hi>grace.</hi> Laſtly, without this <hi>interiour light,</hi> we know not <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Mediatour,</hi> by whoſe <hi>pretious blood</hi> we are Redeemed from <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> and reſtored to a <hi>life</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay if God imparts this <hi>light</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> to all, how comes it ſo many remain in <hi>darkneſs,</hi> and infidelity; of this the reaſon is, that it is required to the end the <hi>light</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> may have its <hi>effect,</hi> a <hi>cooperation</hi> in our <hi>wills,</hi> otherwiſe this <hi>ray</hi> (how glorious ſo e're it be) is rendered <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> and as it vvere under a <hi>Cloud:</hi> Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> ad Rom. 10. ſayes, <hi>Faith which juſtifies muſt come from the heart;</hi> and in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. Chriſt reprehends the Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> that notwithſtanding he had filled them vvith the beams of his light, <hi>yet their hearts were ſlow in admitting a belief; Job</hi> likewiſe confirms this Chap. 24. ſaying; <hi>they were obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and rejected the light preſented to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Learned Graduate</hi> and <hi>Petitioner</hi> more happy, rejected not the <hi>internal call</hi> of God by his <hi>ſecret inſpirations,</hi> but correſponded vvith them by a <hi>pious affection</hi> in his <hi>will;</hi> and having a <hi>merciful invitation</hi> to a <hi>feaſt</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> he would not like thoſe gueſts mentioned in the 22.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:54442:172"/> of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Let the conſideration of a <hi>poor Farm,</hi> or a little muſty vvare gain more upon him than the <hi>hope</hi> of this <hi>treaſure,</hi> more <hi>pretious</hi> than the <hi>whole VVorld:</hi> He vvould not preferr <hi>darkneſs</hi> before <hi>light,</hi> nor chooſe to vvallow in <hi>dirt</hi> and <hi>mire,</hi> rather than beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy his <hi>Soul</hi> with a <hi>gift</hi> which will one day ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him <hi>immortal</hi> in glory.

               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> reflecting upon the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God, in that he not only <hi>bids</hi> us ask, but even <hi>gives</hi> us more than we demand; ſayes, <hi>That our ſlothfulneſs ought to bluſh in that God is more ready to give than we are to receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> petitioned for a <hi>Son,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a <hi>promiſe</hi> that his <hi>Seed</hi> should be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed like <hi>Stars</hi> of Heaven, or Sands of the Sea, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> should iſſue forth from his <hi>Loyns.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Jacob's</hi> requeſt was extended only to <hi>Bread,</hi> and a <hi>Garment,</hi> and he was honoured with <hi>Angels</hi> to be his <hi>Companions,</hi> was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker

               </p>
               <p>So our <hi>Penitent</hi> ſeems to be very <hi>modeſt</hi> in his petition knowing well the wont of God's <hi>bounty,</hi> that doth not <hi>ſuccour</hi> us in <hi>one</hi> kind, and leave us <hi>miſerable</hi> in <hi>another,</hi> but relieves <hi>compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> Wherefore he ſues only to have his <hi>Lips</hi> unſealed; for the <hi>reſt</hi> he referrs it to his <hi>incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable munificence,</hi> being fixt in this <hi>Principle,</hi> that according to the <hi>meaſure</hi> of his <hi>donation,</hi> he will exhort, allure, threaten; nay put himſelf into any shape, that may moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually purchaſe Souls unto God.</p>
               <p>Nor is it a bad <hi>preſage</hi> of his <hi>future ſucceſs,</hi> that he is ſo <hi>confident</hi> to have his <hi>Lips</hi> laid open; <hi>Lord</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>thou wilt open my Lips,</hi> as if he had the <hi>Key</hi> of <hi>grace</hi> at his command.

               <p>
                  <hi>Caſsianus</hi> ſayes, it is a <hi>ſign</hi> we shall <hi>obtain</hi> what we <hi>demand,</hi> when we find a <hi>ſtrong faith</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in our ſelves whilſt we offer our <hi>petition:</hi> For Almighty God uſes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire

               <p>Whilſt our <hi>Penitent</hi> goes on in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to make an <hi>Elogy</hi> of his Creatours <hi>prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> he is ſtartled at an <hi>opinion,</hi> that <hi>God is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed in the damnation of a Soul, as much it in her Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> But he ſoon recovered himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>principles</hi> he hath laid; for as a <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>accompliſhed piece of work</hi> ſpeaks more the <hi>art</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>workman,</hi> than <hi>one</hi> that is <hi>imperfect</hi> and be ſet with many faults; ſo a <hi>bleſſed Soul</hi> adorned with many <hi>perfections,</hi> and being <hi>lively image</hi> of her <hi>Maker,</hi> doth more expreſs the <hi>power, wiſdome,</hi> and other <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> of God than a <hi>loſt Soul</hi> all ſtained with a <hi>horrid guilt</hi> of <hi>ſin.</hi>

                  <hi>Again,</hi> it would be indifferent to the moſt zealous in the love of God, whether a ſoul perished or not; becauſe they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring nothing but the <hi>glory</hi> of God, and if that were equally concerned in the <hi>loſs,</hi> or <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of a Soul, certainly either would be a like to them, but it is moſt evident they

               <p>IN this Clauſe our <hi>Petitioner</hi> hints a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſideration; which is, that he will not play the <hi>Heady devote,</hi> nor follow his <hi>own will;</hi> and what his <hi>weak brain</hi> may ſuggeſt unto him in order to God's ſervice, but wiſely
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:54442:180"/> commit himſelf unto <hi>God,</hi> who muſt be his <hi>Maſter</hi> in this particular: For Man's <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is ſo great, the <hi>Clouds</hi> over his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo <hi>black,</hi> that of himſelf he cannot <hi>diſcern</hi> what <hi>homage</hi> is due to his <hi>Sovereign Monarch,</hi> nor with what <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he ought to <hi>adore, thank,</hi> and <hi>appeaſe</hi> him: He knew well our <hi>important affair</hi> in this life, is to <hi>ſerve</hi> God as he <hi>would</hi> be ſerved, and in that way which might be moſt <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him; by conſequence the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he is to obſerve muſt be revealed to him by God, that conformably to his <hi>pleaſure</hi> he is ready to <hi>obey,</hi> to Sacrifice not only a <hi>beaſt,</hi> but his <hi>fortune, honour, crown, perſon,</hi> and <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many Opinions about this Quere; <hi>why thoſe legal Sacrifices inſtituted by God's own appointment, as a teſtimony of our acknowledgment of his ſupream Dominion over us, and being their ſole refuge to ſhelter themſelves from the darts of his anger, ſhould in the caſe of our Petitioner be cenſured as uſeleſs, and no wayes to be countenanced by the approbation of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſay our <hi>Penitent</hi> means by this the bare <hi>external act</hi> of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which as an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary thing without the <hi>intention,</hi> which gives <hi>life</hi> to the <hi>action,</hi> is not required of God, nor receives from him any <hi>ſupport,</hi> and that in this ſenſe he truly doth not authenticate any Sacrifice ſo offered.</p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:54442:181"/>
               <p>But queſtionleſs this <hi>expoſition</hi> is far from our Penitents thoughts, for no <hi>oblation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs veſted with a form of <hi>ſincere reſpect,</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> can find any <hi>propitious effect;</hi> and ſince that depends on the will of him that offers ſacrifice, if <hi>this circumſtance</hi> be wanting, neither will his <hi>immolation</hi> be <hi>accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,</hi> nor <hi>he</hi> himſelf <hi>blameleſs;</hi> if he deſiſt upon that title from diſcharging his <hi>duty</hi> by thoſe Ceremonies which the Law then requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>I will wave the <hi>ſentiments</hi> of divers others ſo to avoid <hi>prolixity,</hi> and give you that of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> who ſeems to have hit upon the <hi>genuine ſenſe</hi> of this clauſe. For he reputes it to be a <hi>prophetick inſpiration</hi> in our <hi>Penitent,</hi> that <hi>the legal Sacrifices being a Type only and Figure of that eternal Sacrifice to be offered up in the perſon of Chriſt, in whom they were all to end. Therefore in conſideration of his vigorous Faith, and ardent zeal for his coming, by which he merited the effect of what they repreſented, he was diſpenſed within theſe legal Sacrifices as to himſelf, they being in theſe circumſtances little beneficial, and as it were unneceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us examine the <hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which will give us light the better to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>verity</hi> of this <hi>clauſe:</hi> Firſt, it exacts that he who <hi>offers</hi> Sacrifice be a <hi>Prieſt;</hi> for ſince it is a <hi>worſhip</hi> of all others the moſt <hi>eminent,</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:54442:181"/> by which the World conſpires in one to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a <hi>Divinity,</hi> it is requiſite this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ceremony,</hi> should not be committed to the Execution of <hi>everyone,</hi> but that certain <hi>ſelected Perſons</hi> be conſtituted, who in the name of the Common-wealth should pay their <hi>homage</hi> to the <hi>divine Majeſty;</hi> and in that action of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> acknowledge both <hi>his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power,</hi> and <hi>their ſubjection;</hi> and <hi>this perſon</hi> ought to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> becauſe it is his <hi>proper office;</hi> witneſs St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Fifth to the <hi>Hebrews, Every Prieſt choſen out amongſt Men are appointed for the ſervice of Men, in thoſe things which relate unto God in the oblation of gifts and Sacrifices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as to the <hi>Law of nature</hi> where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and not of <hi>Prieſts;</hi> St. <hi>Hierom</hi> cites a tradition of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> which teſtifies that the <hi>Firſt born Male,</hi> or <hi>Eldeſt Son</hi> were <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and enjoyed both a <hi>regal,</hi> and <hi>pontificial authority</hi> in their Line, and Family. Whence <hi>Job</hi> Chap. 2. Sacrificed in behalf of his Children, whom likewiſe he bleſſed and ſanctifyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> it is required in a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that it be ſome <hi>external ſenſible thing,</hi> either <hi>living</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate;</hi> for whatſoever by the eſteem of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> or authority of <hi>holy Scripture</hi> hath been reputed a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>true Sacrifice,</hi> it ever conſiſted in ſome ſuch viſible and external thing.</p>
               <pb n="354" facs="tcp:54442:182"/>
               <p>The <hi>third condition</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is, that the <hi>thing</hi> offered up be <hi>killed,</hi> or ſome alteration made in it; for all the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>Moſaick Law</hi> were not performed by a ſimple <hi>oblation</hi> or <hi>elevation</hi> of the thing, but by its <hi>deſtruction,</hi> and this directed to God's <hi>honour. Living Creatures</hi> were <hi>ſlaughtered,</hi> and things <hi>inanimate,</hi> ſome <hi>burnt,</hi> as <hi>Flower, Salt, Incenſe:</hi> Others <hi>poured out</hi> or <hi>ſpilt,</hi> as <hi>Blood, Oyl,</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> The reaſon why a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ought to be <hi>deſtroyed</hi> is, that by the <hi>deſtruction</hi> it ſerves no more to the <hi>uſe</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and ſo more compleatly ſeems all applyed to <hi>God's honour,</hi> as importing his <hi>ſupream Dominion,</hi> and a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency</hi> of all things on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is to be offered up <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly,</hi> or <hi>explicitly</hi> to the <hi>honour</hi> of God; if for any other end it loſes the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> For a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is in the number of thoſe ſigns by which we expreſs our <hi>inward va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue</hi> of anothers <hi>excellency,</hi> and a <hi>deſire</hi> in our ſelves to become his <hi>ſlave,</hi> now if this <hi>eſteem</hi> or <hi>deſire</hi> be wanting, the <hi>ſign is falſe,</hi> and hath <hi>no effect;</hi> ſo that a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> proceeding from <hi>flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> or <hi>fear</hi> is <hi>impious,</hi> and puts a <hi>ſcorn</hi> upon the <hi>Deity</hi> they ſeem to adore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the place wherein a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ought to be conſecrated to that end, and this we call an <hi>Altar,</hi> for doubtleſs
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:54442:182"/> the <hi>dignity</hi> of that <hi>action</hi> may juſtly exact a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>department</hi> ſeparated from <hi>prophane uſes,</hi> as the cuſtom of all Nations declares.</p>
               <p>From theſe <hi>premiſes</hi> we ſee what a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is taken in the <hi>ſtricteſt ſenſe;</hi> to wit, an <hi>external oblation</hi> of ſome ſenſible thing offered unto God, by which we acknowledge his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power over <hi>us,</hi> and <hi>all things:</hi> that he may diſpoſe of <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us</hi> at his pleaſure. Now that God should not require at the hands of our <hi>Petitioner</hi> ſuch an <hi>expreſsion</hi> of his <hi>duty</hi> ſeems intricate, becauſe though by the <hi>tye</hi> of <hi>nature</hi> we are obliged to worship God by <hi>acts of vertue;</hi> and <hi>good works</hi> iſſuing from ſuch a principle, may quadrate with the end of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is to <hi>honour</hi> God: Yet they produce no <hi>external ſign,</hi> and ſo properly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be an <hi>act of Religion,</hi> nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which comprehends the moſt <hi>perfect worſhip</hi> that can be given by a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is moſt certain that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> very ſtrictly, and this appears in God's <hi>promiſes</hi> to the punctual obſervers of it; as that <hi>rain</hi> should fall in due ſeaſon, their <hi>Lands</hi> become fertile, their <hi>Trees</hi> be laden with fruit, <hi>abundance</hi> in their Vineyards, that they should be <hi>preſerved</hi> from wild Beaſts, enjoy a <hi>full peace,</hi> overcome
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:54442:183"/> their <hi>Enemies,</hi> and plant themſelves in the midſt of them; Nay more, that theſe <hi>temporal bleſsings</hi> were to be Crowned with <hi>eternal life,</hi> of which <hi>promiſe</hi> made to the firſt inhabitants of the Earth, they had a <hi>Tradition,</hi> though their Law made no mention of it. So that not only for their <hi>temporal proſperity,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in order to <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal treaſures,</hi> they were bound to obey their <hi>legal precepts,</hi> and this in <hi>conſcience</hi> under the penalty of a <hi>mortal</hi> or <hi>venial guilt,</hi> according to the <hi>matter</hi> wherein they tranſgreſſed. Now this <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was extended not only to their <hi>moral,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial precepts,</hi> but likewiſe to their <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> and <hi>Politick;</hi> for why should not <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>temporal Lawes</hi> bind in <hi>Conſcience,</hi> ſince we are tyed by a certain <hi>external Juſtice</hi> in morality to contribute to the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>quiet order</hi> of the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> they are commanded by God as well as the others, and pronounced with the like <hi>benedictions,</hi> and <hi>maledictions;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>obligatory</hi> after the ſame manner. It was upon this ground they ſet more by <hi>one precept</hi> of the Law, than by <hi>their lives,</hi> or whatſoever elſe moſt <hi>precious</hi> to them: For example <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> and the Mother of the <hi>Machabees</hi> with her Sons, choſe rather to <hi>dye,</hi> than to <hi>eat Swines fleſh</hi> forbidden by the <hi>Law;</hi> it was in
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:54442:183"/> purſuance of this their <hi>zeal,</hi> that when the <hi>Romans</hi> firſt took <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> under <hi>Pompey,</hi> and forcibly entering the <hi>Temple,</hi> mowed down all before them; neither the <hi>terrour</hi> of death, nor <hi>outcryes</hi> of the dying Multitude round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, could divert them from their <hi>divine ſervice, oblations,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> but on the contrary were reſolved to lye at the <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of the <hi>victorious,</hi> and ſuffer what they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rather then abandon their <hi>Altars,</hi> on quit any part of their <hi>duty,</hi> in obſerving what was commanded by their <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſince theſe <hi>legal Sacrifices</hi> were ſo much valued by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and obſerved with ſo much <hi>zeal,</hi> as inſtituted by God's own <hi>appointment,</hi> in Teſtimony of our <hi>acknowledgment, of his ſupream power,</hi> and <hi>our ſubjection,</hi> and being they were their ſole <hi>refuge</hi> to shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the <hi>darts</hi> of his <hi>anger,</hi> how comes it to paſs that in the caſe of our <hi>Petitioner</hi> they are cenſured <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> and no wayes to be countenanced from Heaven: For as here he expreſly declares, that God would not have him pay this <hi>tribute</hi> or <hi>homage</hi> of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, ſo we have reaſon to believe he did it not; for it is no where read, that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up any <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi>'s murder, or his adultery with <hi>Berfabee;</hi> though uſually all
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:54442:184"/> offendours in that nature did it, nor were to be admitted into <hi>humane Society</hi> untill they had purifyed themſelves by a <hi>Sacrifice of expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some there are who fancy that our <hi>Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner</hi> underſtands here, that <hi>legal Sacrifices</hi> were moſt of them appointed for <hi>ſins</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted through <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>negligence:</hi> Now he not finding himſelf <hi>guilty</hi> in this kind, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes that God would not exact a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of him upon that ſcore.</p>
               <p>But this cannot hold Water, for certain it is, that many of thoſe <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted for the <hi>expiation of ſeveral treſpaſſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion;</hi> and namely <hi>thoſe</hi> which gave birth to this his <hi>penitential Pſalm:</hi> Beſides, he ſeems to be much devoted to that kind of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which was ordained for <hi>ſins of ignorance,</hi> often ſupplicating the <hi>Divine mercy</hi> in behalf of his <hi>ſecret,</hi> and <hi>hidden ſins,</hi> which muſt needs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his <hi>faults</hi> into which through <hi>ignorance</hi> he may have fallen; and therefore upon that ſcore he would never deſiſt from the <hi>offering up</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others again interpret this clauſe of our <hi>Petitioner,</hi> as if he would ſay, Lord should I offer up thoſe <hi>Sacrifices</hi> commanded in the <hi>Law</hi> they will not <hi>pleaſe,</hi> nor <hi>appeaſe</hi> thee? They are but <hi>figures</hi> and <hi>repreſentations</hi> of that <hi>true Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>

               <p>But with ſubmiſſion I conceive our <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner</hi> in this clauſe appeals to his <hi>great God,</hi> and inſinuates it, is his <hi>revealed will</hi> he should deſiſt from theſe <hi>Sacrifices;</hi> as being all ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed with his <hi>internal acts of repentance,</hi> which more perfectly contribute to the <hi>effect</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> (though not to the <hi>formality</hi> of it) than any <hi>external oblation;</hi> For this expreſſion <hi>if you would have had one</hi> (ſuppoſing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God in general to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in all their diſtreſſes they were to make <hi>their way</hi> to him by the <hi>means of Sacrifice</hi>) imports a knowledge he had to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, otherwiſe he would never have put in an <hi>if,</hi> nor made a Quere whether he should

               </p>
               <p>Now, if you ask me <hi>why God ſhould proceed ſo particularly with him,</hi> it ſeems to me probable, that it was in conſideration of his <hi>vigorous Faith,</hi> and <hi>ardent zeal</hi> for the coming of the <hi>Meſsias,</hi> by which he merited the <hi>effect</hi> of what the <hi>legal Sacrifices</hi> did repreſent; and ſo was diſpenſed with, in order to all thoſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi> as to <hi>him</hi> with theſe circumſtances lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle beneficial.</p>
               <p>For we ſee in ſeveral Emergencies, that God would not tye himſelf to the <hi>ſtrict rules</hi> he had ſet down for the <hi>guidance</hi> of his <hi>people;</hi> he had ordained that <hi>Prieſts</hi> only were to be the <hi>lawful Miniſters of Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication of this Law</hi> he punished ſeverely in the perſons of <hi>Ozias</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> Yet at another time by a <hi>particular Ordination,</hi> he enjoyned <hi>Abel, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and others; though they were <hi>not Prieſts</hi> to offer Sacrifice: For by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this <hi>Command</hi> they were <hi>conſecrated Prieſts,</hi> and had the power of Sacrificing committed to them. In like manner our <hi>Petitioner</hi> living in the time of the Law, a <hi>Law of bondage;</hi> where many <hi>harſh impoſitions</hi> were laid upon them, might be exempted from the <hi>burden of Sacrifices,</hi> upon the ſcore of his <hi>Heroick Love, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>ceaſeleſs groans</hi> for a Redeemer:
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:54442:185"/> For doubtleſs amongſt all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the old Teſtament, <hi>none</hi> ever intereſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much in that particular as <hi>he,</hi> and it is believed he much obliged the World by thoſe his <hi>longing deſires,</hi> in haſtning the coming of the Meſſias.</p>
               <p>For all this at the firſt glance, one would think our <hi>Penitent</hi> were lyable to <hi>cenſure:</hi> That knowing he addreſſed himſelf to <hi>one</hi> who is <hi>the ſearcher of hearts,</hi> and before whom the moſt ſecret motions are <hi>diſplayed;</hi> he should nevertheleſs make this <hi>ſuperfluous expreſsion</hi> of his promptitude to <hi>perform</hi> what ever he would <hi>exact</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>But we ought to juſtify our <hi>Penitent,</hi> and believe that <hi>in this</hi> he aims at the <hi>Worlds ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi> to the end after ages might read, he declined not the <hi>uſe</hi> of thoſe <hi>remedies</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> preſcribed, out of any defect of ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Law,</hi> but meerly upon the ſcore of God's <hi>diſpenſation,</hi> who was pleaſed to accept of the <hi>interiour Acts</hi> of his <hi>repentance,</hi> and in that <hi>acceptation,</hi> would inform Mankind, the <hi>heart</hi> is the thing he moſt conſiders.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe grounds our Petitioners <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> carries <hi>weight,</hi> and inferrs that if <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſts</hi> be not countenanced by Heaven, it were in vain to think of any other <hi>oblation,</hi> for amongſt all the <hi>legal Sacrifices,</hi> that of <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſts,</hi> or <hi>Burnt-offerings,</hi> was the moſt <hi>perfect,</hi> and the moſt compleatly expreſſes the <hi>ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> of God's <hi>power</hi> over <hi>us,</hi> and the fulneſs of our <hi>ſubjection</hi> to <hi>him;</hi> for in ſome <hi>Sacrifices</hi> part of them were <hi>burnt,</hi> the reſt applyed to the <hi>uſe</hi> of the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but in <hi>Holocauſts</hi> all

               <p>I obſerve likewiſe in the <hi>ſacred Text,</hi> that if <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were not performed with a <hi>pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and deteſtation of ſin, they were <hi>odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> in the ſight of God, this appears in the Firſt Chapter of <hi>Eſay;</hi> by whoſe Pen God declares, that <hi>Incenſe was abominable to him, and that he abhorred their Solemnities.</hi> Again, in the <hi>Prov. The Sacrifice offered up by an impious hand is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in his ſight.</hi> For the <hi>end</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is either in order to a <hi>reconciliation</hi> with God, a <hi>return of thanks</hi> for <hi>benefits</hi> received, or for the <hi>impetration</hi> of ſome <hi>new favour:</hi> Now to <hi>pretend</hi> to any of theſe, and not <hi>renounce</hi> all affection to Sin were rather to <hi>provoke,</hi> than any wayes <hi>appeaſe</hi> his <hi>anger:</hi> But our <hi>Petitioner</hi> delivers not the thing with that <hi>horrour,</hi> he touches not upon any <hi>abomination,</hi> or <hi>ſeverity</hi> on God's part, but expreſſes it in the <hi>Negative</hi> of any <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> he will take in it, which concludes his <hi>Sacrificing action</hi> would not be rejected upon the ſcore of any <hi>real-guilt,</hi> but as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to him, who was priviledged with the conditions of a more <hi>efficacious oblation,</hi> and therefore juſtly he might cry, <hi>thou art not delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Holocauſts.</hi>

                  <hi>This Clauſe</hi> hath ſet a work many <hi>great wits,</hi> and pushed them on ſo far, as to aſſert that <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were not <hi>commanded</hi> in the old Law, but only <hi>permitted</hi> as a leſſer Evil, as to make them decline <hi>Idolatry;</hi> which that groſs peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo apt to ſlide into, and to shew this was the <hi>end of that Inſtitution,</hi> they obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve thoſe <hi>Beaſts</hi> were appointed, and mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out for their <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> which were the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> adored by the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> as a <hi>Sheep,</hi> a <hi>Goat,</hi> a <hi>Kid,</hi> an <hi>Ox,</hi> a <hi>Calf,</hi> a <hi>Dove,</hi> a <hi>Sparrow,</hi> a <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;</hi> that whilſt they mangled, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe <hi>Animals</hi> they might reflect upon that <hi>one ſupream God,</hi> before whom all <hi>other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> muſt lye proſtrate, and by their <hi>deſtruction</hi> acknowledge his <hi>Sovereign Dominion.</hi>

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:54442:189"/> of the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> inflicting <hi>puniſhments</hi> on the <hi>infringers,</hi> which ſpeaks more than bare permiſſion: Nay, he owns the <hi>perfume</hi> ariſing from a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> to be moſt <hi>Odoriferous,</hi> and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him.</p>
               <p>You muſt know then that <hi>one motive</hi> in the Inſtitution of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> was to divert the <hi>Jews</hi> from dangers of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> juſt as now one of the <hi>intentions</hi> in <hi>marriage</hi> may be to avoid <hi>fornication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Another motive</hi> was to prefigure that <hi>bloody Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> to be offered up in the <hi>new Law;</hi> for the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> was to know <hi>love,</hi> and obey <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo that all their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> tended to his <hi>inſtruction:</hi> They were as a kind of <hi>bond,</hi> or <hi>engagement</hi> by vvhich the <hi>new Law</hi> vvas promiſed to them.</p>
               <p>So that if they addreſſed them under that <hi>Form,</hi> and attired vvith theſe <hi>circumſtances,</hi> they were queſtionleſs <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> in the ſight of God, and in this ſenſe the Law ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged all in general unto <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> yet this hinders not, but our <hi>Petitioner</hi> prevented with <hi>extraordinary Graces,</hi> may be taught another <hi>method of Sacrifice,</hi> and truly he inſinuates as much in his 39. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where he owns to have received a <hi>command</hi> to performe the <hi>will</hi> of God, and adds he had done it; and this in planting his <hi>Law,</hi> that is <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the

               </p>
               <p>I am not Ignorant there are many who lay the <hi>force of this expreſsion</hi> upon the <hi>ſole ineffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> whoſe <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> did not <hi>Phyſically</hi> and <hi>really</hi> conferr Grace, but only after a moral way, prefigured and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed it forth; depending more upon the diſpoſition of <hi>him</hi> that <hi>offered,</hi> than on any <hi>innate vertue</hi> contained in <hi>themſelves;</hi> and upon this ground our <hi>Petitioner</hi> might alledge that <hi>burnt-offerings</hi> would not ſerene his <hi>angry looks,</hi> ſince they did but <hi>diſcover</hi> the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Spiritual directors lay down as the <hi>ground work</hi> of a life of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> an <hi>interiour abnegation</hi> of our ſelves, by which we give a <hi>repulſe</hi> to our ſelves: For when once we come to deveſt our ſelves of <hi>love,</hi> then the <hi>terrours of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:54442:196"/> torments,</hi> and <hi>adverſity</hi> will find no <hi>effect,</hi> then generous, and Heroick Acts will be the productions of ſuch a Soul; for <hi>ſolid ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> like a <hi>Roſe</hi> amidſt <hi>Thornes</hi> ſeldome ſprings forth but in the <hi>ſoyl of croſſes, auſterities,</hi> and <hi>repentance.</hi> Thoſe that are ſeiſed with this <hi>holy averſion</hi> againſt themſelves, mind not the <hi>hardſhips</hi> they are to wade through in making good their <hi>fidelity</hi> to God, they throw <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> upon the points of <hi>Halberts,</hi> and other inſtruments of <hi>ſeverity;</hi> without the leaſt <hi>whining</hi> or <hi>flinching</hi> at their <hi>ſharpneſs:</hi> they take in as it were with the ſame relish the <hi>Gall</hi> of <hi>misfortunes,</hi> and <hi>deſolations,</hi> and the <hi>Hony</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperities</hi> and <hi>comforts:</hi> No <hi>ſtormy ſeaſon</hi> hinders their <hi>Journey,</hi> and that which <hi>diſturbs</hi> ſoft and effeminate Spirits is to them <hi>matter of joy,</hi> and <hi>repoſe;</hi> becauſe they <hi>poſſeſs</hi> what they <hi>deſire,</hi> to wit, <hi>affliction;</hi> ſo that all things which paſs under the name of <hi>Adverſity,</hi> are not ſo, but to the <hi>wicked</hi> who make ill uſe of them in prizing the <hi>Creature,</hi> more than the <hi>Creatour:</hi> Hence it is that the <hi>general ſpirit of Saints</hi> have carried them on to be <hi>ambitious of ſuffering,</hi> and to reckon it amongſt one of the <hi>choice favours of Heaven;</hi> for they had learnt by experience, that if God with one Hand reaches unto them the <hi>Cup</hi> of his <hi>paſsion,</hi> it is but by <hi>ſnatches</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:54442:197"/> and as it were a <hi>ſup,</hi> whilſt with the <hi>other</hi> he gives them <hi>large draughts of conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is noted in the ſacred Text, that God laid open the perſon of <hi>Job</hi> to all the aſſaults of <hi>Satan,</hi> but with <hi>this reſerve,</hi> that he touch not upon his life; and this not in regard that <hi>death</hi> would have ecclipſed the <hi>glory</hi> of that <hi>great Champion,</hi> but becauſe he would not be deprived of ſuch a <hi>Combatant</hi> to whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict <hi>he,</hi> and <hi>his bleſſed Angels</hi> were intent with much ſatisfaction, and ſo would not loſe the <hi>pleaſure</hi> of ſeeing this ſtout <hi>skirmiſh,</hi> fought out to the laſt 'twixt <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>Enemy.</hi> And as the <hi>Heathen Emperours</hi> took great delight to ſee a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> enter into the <hi>liſt</hi> with a <hi>wild Beaſt;</hi> ſo the <hi>King of Heaven</hi> is ſolaced with the <hi>ſight</hi> of one of his <hi>Saints,</hi> when he maintains a <hi>Fight</hi> againſt thoſe <hi>fierce Beaſts</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> out of the <hi>principles of humane wiſdom,</hi> drew this excellent ſaying, <hi>that no object was more worthy in the Eyes of the gods, than to behold a ſtout Man with a ſettled countenance unmoved to ſtruggle with adverſe Fortune:</hi> and truly the <hi>delay</hi> our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour made, in ſending <hi>ſuccour</hi> to his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> endangered by a <hi>ſtorm</hi> at Sea, ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hints unto us, the <hi>pleaſure</hi> God takes to ſee the <hi>Juſt row againſt the ſtream,</hi> tugg and wreſtle

               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how happy our Holy <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> hath ajuſted his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the lines of God's will, and that he never ſpake more emphatically than when he ſaid, <hi>A Sacrifice to God is a troubled ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſayes, that <hi>honor is due to God in four ſeveral reſpects, and in like manner we ought in as many wayes render it unto him:</hi> Firſt, <hi>in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many bleſsings, and this is to be returned by our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and acts of thanksgiving:</hi> Next, <hi>we owe him honor in that he hath laid his commands upon us, and this we perform by our obedience, and ſubmiſsion to his Laws:</hi> Thirdly, <hi>his greatneſs and ſovereignity exact it at our hands, and this is paid by the vertue of Latria, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi> Laſtly, <hi>honor is due unto him in that he hath been offended, and injuriouſly treated by ſin:</hi> Now the <hi>honor</hi> due to him in this point is reſtored by <hi>Penitential acts,</hi> and by a <hi>troubled ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe, in regard of his <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> and to make <hi>reparation</hi> for the <hi>contempts</hi> thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Majeſty, he is ready <hi>to humble himſelf,</hi> and apply all his <hi>endeavour</hi> to works of <hi>piety,</hi> ſo far as even <hi>to afflict himſelf,</hi> that he might honor the Divine Juſtice, which requires that <hi>ſin</hi> should never go <hi>unpuniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore God is delighted in theſe <hi>painful ſatisfactory acquittances,</hi> which we often
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:54442:198"/> give him written in our <hi>ſweat,</hi> and <hi>blood:</hi> And Jeſus Chriſt makes of <hi>them</hi> a <hi>preſent</hi> to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> with his <hi>own,</hi> from whence the <hi>value of ours</hi> is derived, and there they find <hi>acceptance,</hi> not upon the ſcore of any <hi>contentment</hi> it is to God that we are <hi>tormented</hi> either in <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> but meerly in that by them his <hi>Juſtice</hi> is <hi>honored</hi> and <hi>exalted,</hi> and the <hi>Palms</hi> of our <hi>victory</hi> more <hi>reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>anxiety</hi> of <hi>ſpirit</hi> ſupported with a <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient reſignation,</hi> and ſtrengthened with a <hi>fervent prayer,</hi> purchaſed to the diſtreſſed <hi>Anna,</hi> and to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, that great Prophet <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi> This ſame <hi>diſturbance</hi> of <hi>Spirit,</hi> carried on by a <hi>generous ſubmiſsive reſolution</hi> againſt all the Machinations of <hi>Saul,</hi> put into the Hands of our <hi>Penitent</hi> the <hi>Scepter</hi> of <hi>Juda;</hi> in a word, it ſeems to be a <hi>principle</hi> ſetled <hi>in Heaven,</hi> that <hi>without this Sacrifice of a troubled ſpirit, he will not part with his bleſsings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be objected that God <hi>knowes</hi> the Hearts of Men, and what they will do, and therefore he need not this <hi>external Teſtimony:</hi> Next, that Chriſt's <hi>merits</hi> being of an <hi>infinite value, ours</hi> appear altogether <hi>ſuperfluous;</hi> to which I anſwer: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that his <hi>external glory</hi> conſiſting in the <hi>viſible homages</hi> payd to him by his <hi>Creatures,</hi> this would be wanting should he give them no occaſion to make it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:54442:198"/> and shew unto the World, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants who value no <hi>ſuffering</hi> in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>duty</hi> they owe him: Beſides the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> we shall take in Heaven to have done ſomething to merit our <hi>Beatitude,</hi> will certainly be a great <hi>addition</hi> to our <hi>Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>other,</hi> though I confeſs the <hi>merits</hi> of Chriſt <hi>all ſufficient,</hi> yet this will not excuſe us from offering what we can <hi>in ſatisfaction,</hi> for the <hi>Honor</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of all our actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God; now it being an <hi>Act of injuſtice</hi> to defraud any one of his <hi>revenue,</hi> no leſs is it againſt <hi>equity</hi> to deprive God of the <hi>glory</hi> due unto him: Wherefore a <hi>life</hi> that contributes not to his <hi>glory</hi> is <hi>perverſe</hi> and <hi>wicked.</hi> Again he that owns a <hi>Tree,</hi> hath likewiſe right to the <hi>fruit</hi> it bears, if the <hi>Land</hi> be mine, the <hi>Crop</hi> alſo is at my diſpoſal; the <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of a <hi>Horſe</hi> is due to his <hi>Maſter:</hi> In like manner all that we <hi>are,</hi> all the good we <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>ſhall do,</hi> is the <hi>work</hi> of God, and a <hi>preſent</hi> with which he <hi>enriches</hi> us, that we might be able to <hi>give</hi> ſomething to him: Wherefore as <hi>all</hi> is <hi>his,</hi> our <hi>duty</hi> binds us to conſecrate all our <hi>interiour,</hi> and <hi>exteriour actions</hi> to promote his <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>glory:</hi> And ſince it is reaſonable <hi>ſin</hi> should be <hi>puniſhed,</hi> our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> ſubmits to the <hi>decree,</hi> expoſes himſelf to be wracked

               <p>ST. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſayes, <hi>no fond Lover dotes ſo much upon his Miſtreſs, as God doth on a Soul truly Penitent;</hi> and then making an Apoſtrophe unto Tears, he cryes, <hi>O happy ſtreams, all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers ſtrike Sail to you: The countenance of a Judge affrights you not, your accuſing adverſaries are ſtruck dumb, before you: It is you alone that finds admittance, and are entertained by your Sovereign, you only can overcome the invincible, and tye up the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I read theſe words of this great Saint upon the efficacy of <hi>Tears,</hi> I am ſtartled at the ſlender Character our <hi>Petitioner</hi> gives in this clauſe: <hi>A contrite heart</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>O God thou wilt not deſpiſe:</hi> An <hi>expreſsion</hi> which falls much short of a Lovers <hi>paſsion;</hi> for to have
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:54442:200"/> no other return of a <hi>preſent,</hi> than barely <hi>not</hi> to have it <hi>rejected,</hi> argues the <hi>gift</hi> very little prized by the <hi>receiver,</hi> and is in the next door to a <hi>contempt.</hi> But yet the addition our <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> makes of <hi>humble,</hi> ſpeaks very much and helps out the ſentence: For it imports, that <hi>humility</hi> teaches him the <hi>excellency</hi> of God, and at the ſame time <hi>his own nothing;</hi> ſo that not to find a repulſe in the exhibition of any <hi>homage</hi> rendered to a <hi>Being</hi> infinitely perfect, is an <hi>endearing</hi> beyond what a <hi>poor Creature</hi> could any wayes in Juſtice expect; and therefore in theſe <hi>lowly thoughts</hi> it ſeems to him he ſets out God's <hi>mercy</hi> in ſaying; <hi>A contrite and humble heart thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore it is evident our <hi>Petitioner</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes upon <hi>ſure principles,</hi> and ſpeaks he is well read in <hi>Divinity;</hi> for if <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> and <hi>penal works</hi> be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> pleaſing to God (as is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in the precedent clauſe) much more a <hi>contrite heart</hi> muſt needs be highly accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which is a <hi>total deſtruction</hi> of all <hi>love</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> a <hi>deteſtation</hi> and <hi>diſlike</hi> againſt it; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves a <hi>paſsion</hi> of <hi>ſorrow</hi> conſequent to this <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> and a firm purpoſe to avoid all future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>motive</hi> of this <hi>ſorrow</hi> muſt be in that we have offended the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God, who merits all <hi>love, honor,</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> from us;
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:54442:200"/> and therefore meerly in that <hi>ſin</hi> is diſpleaſing to him, we are to retract and abominate our paſt miſdeeds.</p>
               <p>Our Holy <hi>Penitent,</hi> the more effectually to create within him this <hi>lively compunction,</hi> conſiders that by <hi>ſin</hi> we deny unto God the juſt <hi>tribute</hi> of <hi>ohedience,</hi> as if in a manner we would wreſt his <hi>Scepter</hi> from his <hi>Hand,</hi> and in ſequel reduce him to <hi>nothing;</hi> for God cannot be God, nor ſubſiſt, without a <hi>ſoveraign Empire</hi> over all things, it being an <hi>attribute</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately reſulting from his Divine and Infinite Majeſty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> he weighs how God hates <hi>ſin</hi> even to <hi>death;</hi> witneſs his <hi>Commandements</hi> impoſed under ſuch <hi>heavy penalties</hi> on the <hi>tranſgreſſors.</hi> The <hi>rebellious Angels,</hi> our firſt parent <hi>Adam,</hi> the univerſal <hi>Deluge,</hi> conflagration of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> &amp;c. are frightful examples. After he had run over all theſe <hi>puniſhments,</hi> it was eaſy for him to judge of ſin's <hi>horrour,</hi> and how much it is abominated by God; nay he yet ſtooped lower, and beheld many eternally doomed to the <hi>flames</hi> of <hi>hell,</hi> and this perhaps but for <hi>one only mortal ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe <hi>dreadful preſidents</hi> he proceeds further, and in his <hi>prophetick view</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the Son of God <hi>innocent, undefiled,</hi> and ſet at a great diſtance from any <hi>ſin,</hi> to paſs
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:54442:201"/> through the higheſt rigours of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and this meerly becauſe he had taken upon him our <hi>iniquities.</hi> Hence he concludes, if the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Father</hi> be ſo <hi>ſevere</hi> to the dear producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of himſelf in chaſtiſing the prevaricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of another, he will certainly redouble his <hi>ſtripes</hi> on Man for his own proper defaults: Conformably to this meditation St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, <hi>If a Redeemer be ſo roughly handled upon the ſcore of anothers tranſgreſsion, what may a ſinner expect in revenge of his own miſcarriage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> our <hi>Penitent</hi> layes down how by <hi>ſin</hi> we are declared <hi>Enemies</hi> to God, enſlaved to <hi>Satan,</hi> odious in the ſight of <hi>Angels,</hi> and doomed to ſuffer in <hi>Hell</hi> without end; which infinitely exceeds all the <hi>diſaſters</hi> of <hi>this life.</hi> Beſides, we loſe the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> of God, a <hi>treaſure</hi> above all other imaginable, and whoſe <hi>forfeiture</hi> we ought more to deplore, than all other <hi>misfortunes</hi> joyned together: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>one mortal ſin</hi> is more to be lamented, than <hi>all</hi> the <hi>diſgraces</hi> and <hi>hardſhips</hi> which poſſibly may befall us in this World.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Petitioner</hi> having by theſe <hi>remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> alarm'd all the <hi>faculties</hi> of his Soul, and ſo diſpoſed <hi>them</hi> for <hi>action,</hi> juſt like <hi>Souldiers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>Arms;</hi> he then inſtructs them how to redeem all their <hi>dammages</hi> they have ſuſtained by <hi>ſin.</hi>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> they muſt abhorr their <hi>paſt miſdeeds,</hi> that is, have ſuch an averſion as heartily to wish they had never been committed, and ſince the <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>eſſence</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> ſprings from the <hi>will,</hi> it muſt be ruined by the <hi>ſame power,</hi> retracting, diſowning, and as much as in us lyes, breaking the <hi>force</hi> of ſin in becoming <hi>unvoluntary.</hi>

               <p>But what need we ſeek for authorities to ſtrengthen this Doctrine, when our <hi>Penitent</hi> had this happy Truth wrought in himſelf; for no ſooner he had cryed <hi>peccavi,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented what he had done, when the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> published his deliverance, and that his ſin was taken from him, ſo that he had all reaſon to aſſert; <hi>a contrite and humble heart O God thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi>

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:54442:208"/> theſe excellent words: <hi>The Care of God over thee is ſo tender and prudent, that when ignorantly thou doſt petition for what is uſeleſs, or perhaps prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to thee: he is deaf to thee in this particular, yet will exchange it into ſome gift or other more to thy advantage.</hi> For example, ſuppoſe you ask to be freed from ſome <hi>affliction</hi> that ſeems very <hi>heavy</hi> to you, if God grant you <hi>patience,</hi> it is a <hi>bleſsing</hi> beyond the <hi>deliverance</hi> you ſeek after: Again, you would be exempted from this or that <hi>temptation;</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> made it his <hi>earneſt ſuit,</hi> but if God give you <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>courage</hi> to repreſs it, in ſuch ſort as to receive <hi>no injury,</hi> but an <hi>encreaſe of merit,</hi> you have no reaſon to repine: So that God is alwayes <hi>faithful</hi> in his <hi>promiſes,</hi> and never <hi>breaks his word</hi> with his Creatures, but gives the <hi>effect of prayer</hi> either in the <hi>ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal thing demanded,</hi> or in that which is <hi>more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi> if I ſay it be asked with <hi>faith, hope, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> and concerning neceſſaries to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſayes, the Soul hath <hi>power</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by <hi>grace</hi> to cultivate herſelf, and by a <hi>pious induſtry</hi> purchaſe and get into the <hi>poſſeſsion</hi> of all <hi>vertues;</hi> by which she may be delivered from the difficulties of <hi>concupiſcence</hi> which torments her; and of <hi>ignorance</hi> that blinds her.

               <p>Laſtly, as to <hi>good manners,</hi> or <hi>natural precepts,</hi> this great <hi>Architect</hi> hath made of them a more clear and ample explication, by which the will is rectifyed, and carried on to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of greater things than were propoſed in the <hi>Moſaick Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What juſt reaſon then had our <hi>Petitioner</hi> to make this edifice of <hi>Jeruſalem's</hi> Wall the object of his moſt <hi>fervent prayer,</hi> and that all his <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> should <hi>ſubſcribe</hi> to the petition, and <hi>offer up</hi>

               <p>The next compoſition of this ſtructure is foretold by the Prophet <hi>Eſay; I will lay in the foundation of Sion a ſtone that hath endured the touch, a corner and precious ſtone founded in the foundation:</hi> This is <hi>Peter</hi> and his ſucceſſours, <hi>that rock</hi> on whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath built his <hi>Church,</hi> and which hath been tryed by all the aſſaults of Earth and Hell: Nor hath this ſtone proved only of right temper, in which no engin of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could work a flaw, but it is shaped into a <hi>corner ſtone,</hi> by which the two walls of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> are united together, and make one <hi>Chriſtian Church:</hi> It is alſo precious in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly diſtributing her <hi>Spiritual Treaſures</hi> throughout the World; as the clear expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of her Doctrine by <hi>univerſal conſent,</hi> the rights of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which delivered with a <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> in <hi>faith,</hi> is the bond of peace, the <hi>Life and Soul of Religion.</hi> Laſtly, it is <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the foundation</hi> which shews it to be a <hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary foundation:</hi> The firſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares; <hi>no Man can lay any other foundation</hi> (that is primary

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>after him</hi> the <hi>next groundwork</hi> is St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by whom alone, and his ſucceſſours we are to arrive at Chriſt, and what can be to God more glorious than to make uſe of the <hi>feeble</hi> to confound the <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> to lead Men unto <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>glory.</hi>

               <p>This piece of Workmanship in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is like a <hi>Citadel</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all, and holds its awful title not by <hi>Law of Nations,</hi> but <hi>divine right:</hi> It governs men in order to their <hi>Souls,</hi> and rather under the <hi>notion</hi> of being <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than <hi>Men;</hi> it looks not upon their <hi>temporal eaſe</hi> and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> but hath an Eye to a <hi>life</hi> and <hi>felicity immortal:</hi> It is fortifyed with <hi>divine Lawes,</hi> and maintains a <hi>perpetual skirmiſh</hi> not only with a few <hi>viſible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,</hi> but with an infinity of <hi>inviſible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this <hi>Rock</hi> ſolidly diſpoſed and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> like <hi>Watch-towers</hi> and <hi>ſtrong Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions</hi> are erected; whoſe <hi>office</hi> is to <hi>ſuperintend</hi> over the <hi>Guards</hi> and <hi>Sentinels,</hi> and to protect the weaker part of the Walls from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies aſſaults; this contrivance is ſet down by St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>O Peter upon thy Foundation the Biſhops as pillars of the Church are ſetled and confirmed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="424" facs="tcp:54442:217"/>
               <p>Then <hi>Prieſts, Deacons,</hi> and other officers are aſſigned to render this ſtructure in all points compleat; <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe materials are for the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>ornament</hi> of the Church in her great ſolemnities; <hi>others</hi> as <hi>Prieſts</hi> for the <hi>neceſſary diſcharge</hi> of our <hi>duty</hi> to God; for <hi>religion</hi> teaching us to pay that <hi>honor</hi> and <hi>eſteem</hi> we <hi>owe</hi> to God, is the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of the World, nor can we upon any ſcore be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with in the acknowledgment of theſe <hi>fealties:</hi> Whence <hi>no Nation</hi> hath ever been found ſo <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>barbarous</hi> as not to <hi>own,</hi> and in ſome manner or other to <hi>pay</hi> this <hi>Tribute,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by way of <hi>adoration, praiſe, prayer, ſacrifice, feſtival ſolemnity</hi> or by <hi>ſome external Ceremony:</hi> Now that theſe actions might be duly acquitted, there appears an abſolute neceſſity that ſome ſelected perſon should be ſet apart, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed to this end.</p>
               <p>But above all it was moſt requiſite in the <hi>Evangelical Law,</hi> where a <hi>Prieſt</hi> hath power to offer up a <hi>victime</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> by which in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he renders to God more <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> than all the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> can do in the vaſt durance of <hi>Eternity:</hi> Where <hi>he</hi> is daily to repreſent to the <hi>eternal Father</hi> Chriſt's <hi>holy paſsion,</hi> and by that <hi>moving object</hi> render him <hi>propitious</hi> unto Souls, where he is to <hi>diſengage</hi> Men from the <hi>ſlavery of ſin,</hi> and <hi>jawes of Hell</hi> by

               <p>The <hi>laſt materials</hi> for this <hi>Fabrick</hi> are <hi>lay</hi> and <hi>ſecular perſons</hi> of all ſorts; ſo that of <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> are compoſed <hi>two different</hi> and <hi>great Nations</hi> under the <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> of Chriſt; the Office of the <hi>one</hi> is to <hi>give,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> to <hi>receive;</hi> the <hi>one</hi> communicates by oblation of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and adminiſtration of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> ſpiritual goods, <hi>without</hi> which Men would be like a <hi>Body</hi> deſtitute of a <hi>Soul,</hi> having little tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or elevation unto God; the <hi>others</hi> paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make up the <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> as being framed,

               <p>Thus you ſee our <hi>holy Prophet</hi> was ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous in a matter of no ſmall concern, for within the <hi>limits</hi> of this <hi>ſanctuary</hi> are bounded all the <hi>hopes</hi> of Man's Salvation. <hi>Chriſt was made</hi> (ſayes St. <hi>Paul) cauſe of eternal Salvation unto all thoſe who obey him:</hi> Now his <hi>Commandements</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to <hi>Faith, good manners,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which are not rightly performed but within the boſom of his Church.

               <p>This <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was likewiſe an <hi>oblation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> for ſuppoſing that God would have <hi>ſin puniſhed,</hi> becauſe it is a <hi>decree</hi> of his <hi>eternal Law,</hi> which cannot erre nor want its effect.

Now Chriſt was this <hi>happy Redeemer,</hi> who replenished with <hi>mercy</hi> ſpared not his <hi>ſacred humanity</hi> for our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he dragged us out of the <hi>miſery</hi> wherein we lay after <hi>Adam's ſin,</hi> that by no action of ours we could recover <hi>grace,</hi> or any wayes reach our <hi>juſtification;</hi> this <hi>impotency</hi> Chriſt took away, and purchaſed to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <hi>means of Salvation</hi> in caſe they make <hi>right uſe</hi> of it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore as a <hi>diſobedience</hi> to God's Law, a <hi>Pride</hi> in thwarting his greatneſs, and a <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> in our converſion to a Creature are found in ſin; <hi>all theſe</hi> were confronted in Chriſt's <hi>paſsion,</hi> by a prodigious <hi>obedience,</hi> an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>humility,</hi> and a perpeſſion of the moſt <hi>exquiſite torments</hi> that could be inflicted; ſo that there was not the leaſt <hi>punctilio of equity</hi> wanting in this <hi>oblation of Juſtice.</hi>

               <p>Heretofore God made himſelf known by deſtroying <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all his Hoſt, but now he will get himſelf a <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Fame</hi> by playing the <hi>Holocauſt,</hi> and dying upon the <hi>Croſs.</hi>

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:54442:225"/> his prophetick view his thoughts to other <hi>inferiour offerings,</hi> as the off-ſpring and reſult of this ſupreamly great one: Such are the <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons,</hi> who raiſed above the charms of <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> embrace the Councels, and Rules of higheſt perfection given by our Saviour, and quitting all <hi>Earthly intereſts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate themſelves totally to <hi>God.</hi>

                  <hi>Theſe</hi> our <hi>Petitioner</hi> shadowes under the name of <hi>Calves</hi> (according to <hi>Enthymius</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having never taſted the <hi>Yoak,</hi> but let looſe to their full ſwinge and <hi>liberty,</hi> do yet of their own accord make themſelves a daily Sacrifice unto God: For he that embraces ſuch a ſtate of perfection forſakes all; firſt, he forſakes <hi>himſelf,</hi> renouncing in ſome ſort all right over himſelf, and to become a <hi>ſlave</hi> to God in the <hi>perſon of another,</hi> who in the name of God, and in his ſtead accepts the donation and ſurrender of himſelf; and it is upon <hi>theſe terms,</hi> that he may be conducted to <hi>perfection;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Final motive</hi> of this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> is the <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>univerſal practiſe</hi> of all kind of <hi>vertues.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Riches, honour,</hi> and <hi>pleaſure</hi> are the three main <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>perfection;</hi> all which are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued in the eſſential obligations of this perfect State. <hi>Poverty</hi> choaks the deſire after temporal goods; <hi>Chaſtity</hi> allays the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:54442:225"/> of pleaſure, and <hi>obedience</hi> ſtifles all appetite to Worldly greatneſs: But beſides all this, we are to give to God our <hi>actions,</hi> our <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>employments;</hi> and this gift con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the <hi>punctual obſervance of certain Rules</hi> which allot to every one how to ſpend the <hi>Year,</hi> the <hi>Moneth,</hi> the <hi>Week,</hi> the <hi>Day;</hi> nay <hi>every Hour:</hi> So that perſons who devote themſelves to ſuch a <hi>ſtate</hi> need not be ſolicitous for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons leading to perfection; the <hi>Commandements</hi> of God, and <hi>zealous performance</hi> of ſuch <hi>preſcripts</hi> as are given by <hi>ſpiritual maſters,</hi> afford abundant <hi>matter</hi> for this noble <hi>deſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a <hi>comfort</hi> muſt it be to thoſe who are ſetled in this ſtate to think, that there is nothing more excellent in a <hi>Creature,</hi> than to belong in a particular manner to God their <hi>Creatour;</hi> who hath power to glorify and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich them with all good? What can be <hi>more deſirable</hi> than to <hi>grow</hi> every Day, and hour in <hi>perfection,</hi> and this in <hi>ſpirituality,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all others a <hi>treaſure of higheſt value?</hi> We ſee <hi>all Beings</hi> ſtrive to their utmoſt <hi>in this ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Plants</hi> ſpring up, and bear the faireſt <hi>Flowers</hi> that poſſibly they can: <hi>Trees</hi> afford li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally their beſt <hi>fruit; Bodies</hi> iſſue forth all their ſtrength and vigour to become more <hi>powerful</hi> in which their <hi>vertue</hi> conſiſts: And what <hi>invention</hi> is not <hi>hammered</hi> out by <hi>Women</hi> to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:54442:226"/> add the <hi>leaſt ſtroak</hi> to their <hi>natural beauty;</hi> shall the Soul then be alone inſenſible in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of nature? No, no, our <hi>new Law-giver</hi> hath planted in Man a <hi>holy ambition</hi> after <hi>perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and this <hi>ſeed</hi> hath been ſo <hi>fruitful,</hi> and ſo <hi>efficacious,</hi> that one might judge the <hi>abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lives</hi> which ſo many have led in all ages, ſince his viſible appearance upon Earth, were the effects of a ſevere command, rather than a <hi>Paternal Councel,</hi> and that ſuch a <hi>Sacrifice of Calves;</hi> that is, a <hi>religious ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>total abnegation of Earthy intereſt,</hi> could not ſpring from a <hi>frank choice</hi> of the <hi>will,</hi> but from an <hi>abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity:</hi> Wherefore our Holy <hi>Penitent</hi> all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with admiration points out that time wherein theſe wonders shall be wrought; <hi>Then will they put Calves upon thy Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The great <hi>Wheels</hi> which give <hi>motion</hi> to all our <hi>actions</hi> in this life are what is <hi>beneficial, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> and <hi>glorious:</hi> As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> thoſe who addict themſelves to a ſtate of <hi>perfection</hi> find good <hi>rules,</hi> good <hi>example,</hi> ſpiritual <hi>documents,</hi> knowing <hi>directours,</hi> ſeveral exciting <hi>graces,</hi> and all things that lead to the accomplishment of <hi>vertue,</hi> and encreaſe of <hi>merit.</hi> Beſides, he is ſecured from innumerable miſeries of the <hi>World,</hi> which is nothing elſe but a <hi>Chaos</hi> of trouble and confuſion, a <hi>Theatour</hi> of envy, ambition, luxury, tyrannical oppreſſions,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:54442:226"/> a <hi>place</hi> of errour, and darkneſs, overſpread with <hi>nets of temptations,</hi> and cluttered with <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments</hi> of Salvation heaped one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that to be warranted <hi>againſt</hi> ſo many <hi>dangers,</hi> and at the ſame time put into <hi>poſſeſsion of a real good</hi> by the conſtant practice of <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> is an advantage to a humane Creature deſigned for Eternity beyond all other in the World.</p>
               <p>As to the other <hi>motive</hi> which agitates us here; to wit, <hi>things delightful,</hi> none are to be compared to thoſe <hi>raviſhments</hi> encloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the precincts of a <hi>holy retirement:</hi> For they are ſatisfactions of the <hi>Mind,</hi> which being more pure and ſolid than thoſe of the <hi>Body,</hi> do conſequently much outſtrip them in <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>excellency;</hi> the firſt ground of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is a <hi>perfect tranquility of Mind,</hi> which knows no gnawing nor remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>The Soul</hi> (ſayes <hi>Solomon) that reſts in this aſſurance is a continual banquet,</hi> after this <hi>quiet</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds a great <hi>love</hi> to God, which yields a <hi>ſweet reliſh</hi> to the moſt embittered accidents of this life: Then a <hi>vigorous ſubduing of immortifyed paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which like an <hi>Executioner</hi> tortures the greateſt part of Worldlings, and makes them ſpin out this <hi>miſerable life</hi> in an infinity of <hi>anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties,</hi> and <hi>affliction.</hi> In a word, it is the <hi>property of vertue</hi> to affect with <hi>delight</hi> that perſon which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:54442:227"/> puts himſelf upon the performance of any <hi>Heroick action.</hi> Wherefore a ſtate of <hi>perfection</hi> which teaches the <hi>practice</hi> of all <hi>vertues,</hi> in the moſt generous and diſintereſſed way, muſt needs be attended with a <hi>great joy</hi> and <hi>conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> what pleaſure then muſt it be to be ſetled in a <hi>condition of life</hi> which is a <hi>holy reſemblance of Heaven,</hi> ſurrounded with the <hi>precious ornaments</hi> of all <hi>vertues,</hi> wherewith it is decked and ſet forth no leſs than is the <hi>Firmament</hi> embellished with <hi>Stars.</hi>

               <p>O what <hi>pleaſure</hi> to be received into the <hi>Houſhold</hi> and <hi>Family</hi> of God, to be cherished with an <hi>amiable aſpect</hi> from that grand Maſter, and own'd by him as a <hi>Domeſtick;</hi> where a multitude of <hi>graces</hi> and divine <hi>favours</hi> are showred down; where at every turn are offered occaſions of doing well, and arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at an admirable pitch of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> and laſtly, where particular aids of <hi>grace</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to carry us to our <hi>final end</hi> and <hi>ete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>third Engin</hi> which gives <hi>life</hi> to our <hi>actions,</hi> that is <hi>honor;</hi> what greater can there be than for a Soul to be God's <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> his <hi>favourite,</hi> and <hi>friend!</hi> Now this ſtate of <hi>perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> ennobles a perſon with all theſe <hi>titles of greatneſs;</hi> for <hi>vertue</hi> is the ſource of <hi>honor,</hi> and by how much that <hi>excells</hi> in any one, ſo much
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:54442:227"/> is his <hi>honor</hi> really <hi>advanced,</hi> this <hi>ſtate</hi> then being a <hi>nurſery of vertues,</hi> wherein the moſt excellent are practiſed, and in the moſt excellent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as ſquared out to the <hi>Evangelical Councels,</hi> it followes that <hi>ſuch</hi> are <hi>truly noble</hi> who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted under the ſublime <hi>Standard</hi> of ſo perfect and Chriſtian a <hi>warfare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, they practiſe the <hi>method</hi> of getting honor; that is, <hi>by flying it;</hi> for <hi>honor</hi> reſembles a <hi>ſhadow</hi> that flyes the <hi>purſuer,</hi> and purſues the <hi>fugitive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next, they profeſs <hi>humility,</hi> and the Son of God hath proteſted, <hi>that thoſe who humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhall be exalted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they inceſſantly praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God both by their deeds and words; now Chriſt ſayes, <hi>thoſe that glorify him ſhall be glorifyed by him.</hi> Wherefore <hi>this ſtate</hi> cannot be but truly <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>honorable,</hi> in which are compriſed in its perfection all that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our <hi>profit, pleaſure</hi> or <hi>honor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some who would diminish the <hi>worth</hi> of this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> object, that many languish under the <hi>Yoak</hi> of their <hi>vocation,</hi> and lead a <hi>life</hi> more embittered than others in a <hi>worldly converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that thoſe <hi>defects</hi> ſpring not from the <hi>State,</hi> but from the <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyedneſs, pride, indevotion,</hi> and other evil qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:54442:228"/> in particular perſons, who were they <hi>ſuch</hi> as their <hi>ſtate</hi> requires, would trip with <hi>joy</hi> in their <hi>tribulation,</hi> acknowledge themſelves ſingularly countenanced by Heaven, that when they were in the midſt of a <hi>depraved</hi> and <hi>corrupted world,</hi> he drew them off clear from all its <hi>hazzards</hi> and <hi>miſeries;</hi> to plant them <hi>in a Land flowing with Milk and Hony:</hi> That having reſcued them from a <hi>party,</hi> that would have <hi>betrayed</hi> and <hi>given them up to death,</hi> he admitted them <hi>inhabitants</hi> of God's City upon Earth; who will be to them a <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>indulgent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and tranſmit them rich laden with <hi>merit</hi> into the <hi>Land</hi> of the <hi>living;</hi> in caſe they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit themſelves <hi>faithfully</hi> of their <hi>duty:</hi> This I ſay would be their <hi>Harmony</hi> were they not ungrateful, and by their <hi>Chagrin</hi> and <hi>Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented humour,</hi> diſtaſtful to God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo unworthy of the <hi>dignity</hi> of their <hi>ſtate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whilſt I thus exalt this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which is the purchaſe of that <hi>eternal victime</hi> offered up on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> yet I am not ſo tranſported with its <hi>excellency,</hi> as not to know it hath its <hi>proper Croſſes,</hi> nor do I blush to confeſs it, ſince every <hi>difficulty</hi> finds there likewiſe its <hi>Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>indigent life</hi> there led is many times but a <hi>ſimple diſpropriation;</hi> where we find
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:54442:228"/> more neceſſaries for a <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> than an <hi>infinity</hi> of perſons in the World enjoy, who by <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> is feign to continue <hi>poor:</hi> Beſides, this <hi>poverty</hi> will be recompenced with a hundred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold in <hi>eternal treaſures,</hi> and to this perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance the Son of God hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chaſtity</hi> there obſerved is a <hi>life Angelical,</hi> and an imitation of that eternal, wherein <hi>no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> will be admitted, it frees them from a million of <hi>cares, ſufferings</hi> and <hi>perplexities</hi> which married perſons experiment at a dear rate, and thence frankly confeſs their ſtate to be much leſs happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obedience</hi> is a <hi>life</hi> without <hi>curioſity,</hi> a <hi>ſecure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation,</hi> and an <hi>excuſe of weight</hi> with God: It is a <hi>journey</hi> performed <hi>ſleeping;</hi> for whilſt you <hi>obey,</hi> you repoſe quietly in the <hi>conduct</hi> of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and by that, avoid a thouſand <hi>dangers</hi> and <hi>difficulties</hi> incident to thoſe, who live at the <hi>Helm</hi> of their own <hi>will</hi> and <hi>liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If they are ſtartled at the neceſſity of <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting</hi> with ſome who may be of a ſtrange peevish and croſs humour, and with theſe they muſt continue even to <hi>death;</hi> this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs may happen <hi>ſometimes,</hi> yet not <hi>alwayes;</hi> but as to this likewiſe there is often a <hi>miſtake,</hi> the <hi>froward humour</hi> being rather in <hi>themſelves</hi> than in their <hi>companion,</hi> ſo that poſſeſſing a <hi>ſpirit</hi> like
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:54442:229"/> that of the <hi>Jaundice,</hi> all they behold appears <hi>yellow</hi> to them: But admit they are really ſo, that is, thwarting and contradictory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps God hath given <hi>them</hi> to you, that they may be <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>ſaved</hi> by your <hi>mildneſs</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> at leaſt to be unto you <hi>occaſion of merit:</hi> Chriſt our Lord diſdained not to cohabit with <hi>Judas,</hi> and if they diſcharge not their <hi>duty</hi> to you, at leaſt do <hi>yours</hi> to them, and ſo you will hammer out a <hi>Crown</hi> at their coſt, and by means of <hi>their unpleaſing ſtroaks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, if you have a <hi>love</hi> for God, and a <hi>ſerious thought</hi> of Eternity, be it of <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell;</hi> if you conſider the <hi>torments</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, nothing will ſeem <hi>harſh</hi> or <hi>tedious</hi> to you in this life: If you conſider the <hi>immenſe obligations</hi> you owe to your Redeemer, you will lament in that you have but <hi>one life</hi> to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for <hi>him,</hi> that hath loſt his own ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy upon the <hi>Altar</hi> of the <hi>Croſs</hi> for your ſake: You will repine that <hi>nature</hi> allowes you but a term of <hi>ſixty years</hi> or thereabouts in this world to ſpin out in his <hi>ſervice;</hi> ſince he hath ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up <hi>his life</hi> for you, of which <hi>one moment</hi> is more to be valued than all the <hi>duration</hi> and <hi>exiſtence of Men</hi> and <hi>Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Calves,</hi> which our <hi>Penitent</hi> had in his prophetick view, and it leaves a <hi>ſweet reliſh</hi> in his <hi>Mind,</hi> with which he
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:54442:229"/> concludes his petition. It was doubtleſs matter of <hi>great joy</hi> to our <hi>Penitent,</hi> to conſider the <hi>powerful operation</hi> of Chriſt's Spirit, that would draw Men from <hi>ſenſual pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>baits</hi> of this World, induce them to contemn <hi>riches, honors,</hi> and <hi>Earthly glory,</hi> and exchange theſe for <hi>hair-cloths, faſting, diſciplines,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mortifications</hi> of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> and this to be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perſons <hi>great</hi> in <hi>dignity,</hi> ſwimming in a <hi>full plenty of wealth,</hi> and endued with <hi>intellectual parts</hi> even to <hi>admiration:</hi> Millions of theſe have shrowded themſelves within the Walls of a <hi>poor habitation,</hi> where cloathed with a <hi>courſe habit</hi> they have led a <hi>life</hi> wholly <hi>Angelical,</hi> and made themſelves a <hi>daily Sacrifice,</hi> unto God beautifyed with a <hi>religious ſimplicity,</hi> which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes all the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the <hi>prophecy</hi> of our happy <hi>Penitent; Then</hi> (that is in the Church to be eſtablished and founded by the Meſſias) <hi>they will lay Calves on thy Altar.</hi>
